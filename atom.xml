    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Finding-the-Perfect-Video-Dimensions-on-Facebook"><a href="#Finding-the-Perfect-Video-Dimensions-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Finding the Perfect Video Dimensions on Facebook"></a>Finding the Perfect Video Dimensions on Facebook</h2><p>Are you looking for a way to improve your audience engagement on Facebook? Wondering how to make your videos better for your News Feed? Worry not, my friend! We have all the answers!</p><p>Just as we are mindful of the orientation of our pictures, similarly, we should focus on the orientation of our videos as well.</p><p>If you want to take a close-up of someone, you should use the portrait orientation; however, landscape orientation should be your go-to if you want a zoomed-out look. However, in the age of social media, you need to be mindful of where you will post the content.</p><p>This is because different social media platforms support different orientations, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-1.jpg"                      alt="Different Video Aspect Ratios on Mobile Devices"                ></p><p>So, for your Facebook videos, the ideal aspect ratio is 2:3. However, let’s take a closer look and see what works best for you; horizontal video or vertical Facebook video?</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">Bonus Tip! How to Make Horizontal or Vertical Video Using Wondershare Filmora.</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Choose-Vertical-Video-or-Horizontal-Video-for-Facebook"><a href="#Part-1-Choose-Vertical-Video-or-Horizontal-Video-for-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape.

Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

So, does that mean you would not be able to access the watched video again? Not really!</p><p>Regardless of when you have watched the video, there is a way to access it again on Facebook.

Once it opens, input your account credentials (email and password) and sign in to your account.</li><li>Now, navigate to your Facebook profile. You can do so by clicking on your profile picture.</li><li>Click on Activity Log. On the left side, go to the Filters section.</li><li>After that, click on More.

Fortunately, no. No one can see your watch history. However, they can see the action you perform on the video. Here’s a complete list of what other people can see:</p><ul><li><p>**Page:**If you like or follow a page, your friends may see it once they do the same. For example, if you have liked a page related to a Football team, a friend of yours may see your name in the list of followers&#x2F;likes.</p></li><li><p>**Video Likes:**Your name is visible on the likes of the video if you do the same. Say, if you have liked a video and any friend of yours comes across the post. They may see the term “[Your Name] also liked this.” Similarly, your name is visible when you comment on the video.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watched-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="video likes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934254/19272" target="_top" id="1934254">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934254" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934254/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>**Post Shares:**Your name is also visible if you share a video to your timeline or in case of direct messages.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087262/19272" target="_top" id="2087262">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087262" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087262/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-Does-Facebook-Decide-the-Suggested-Videos-3"><a href="#How-Does-Facebook-Decide-the-Suggested-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="How Does Facebook Decide the Suggested Videos?"></a>How Does Facebook Decide the Suggested Videos?</h3><p>The videos suggested on Facebook appear because of liked pages and video popularity.

Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?"></a>Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?</h2><p>Facebook avatars, Snapchat Bitmoji and Apple Memoji are the different versions of the very same idea – each offering users a way to create cartoonish versions of their own and share with others in the conversation. Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.</p><p>Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage. But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apple-memoji-collection.jpg"                      alt="Apple Memoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.apple.com</p><p>FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png"                      alt="Bitmoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.bitmoji.com</p><p>To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji. Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.</p><p>Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-avatar-collection.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Avatar Collection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049387/7443" target="_top" id="2049387">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049387" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049387/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.wptv.com/" >www.wptv.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959707/19272" target="_top" id="1959707">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959707" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959707/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide"></a>How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook"></a>Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook</h4><p>The foremost thing you need to do is ensure you have the newest version of Facebook.

But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apple-memoji-collection.jpg"                      alt="Apple Memoji Collection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135471">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135471%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135471/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>source：support.apple.com</p><p>FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png"                      alt="Bitmoji Collection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134503/19576" target="_top" id="2134503">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134503" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134503/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>source：support.bitmoji.com</p><p>To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji. Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.</p><p>Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-avatar-collection.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Avatar Collection"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.wptv.com/" >www.wptv.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100534/7443" target="_top" id="2100534">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100534" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100534/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide"></a>How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook"></a>Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook</h4><p>The foremost thing you need to do is ensure you have the newest version of Facebook.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The battery life of laptops is continuously improving with each new generation, but no matter how many hours of battery your laptop has there always comes a time when you need those few extra hours when you’re away from an outlet. Thankfully, there are battery packs out there that can do just that like the ChargeTech 27000mAh battery pack, a TSA approved power bank not much larger than your standard paperback book that has a built-in AC outlet and two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to boot.</p><p> To see just how well it works and whether or not it lives up to its hype—and price tag—we put the ChargeTech through the wringer to see just how well it performs.</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-slim"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-slim" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and slim"></a><strong>Design: Sleek and slim</strong></h2><p> The ChargeTech 27000mAh battery pack looks as unassuming as you’d expect. It’s effectively a beefed-up smartphone battery pack that happens to sneak a full-sized AC outlet into it. The rectangular device features tapered sides, which helps add to its slim profile, as well as a satin matte black finish, which we’ll elaborate on more in a minute.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BCvqF82o5dvxOJ6Sb59FZYjknuk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506_2-_7Web-5c900332c9e77c0001eb1ca0.jpg"                      alt="Charge Tech"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> On the top of the ChargeTech 27000mAh is a single power button that serves dual-purpose as the battery life indicator thanks to four LED lights (each of which represents a 25% charge). The various plugins on the device are all located on one edge, save for the input cable, which sits alone on an adjacent side.</p><p> The battery pack relies on an entirely separate charger that will take up even more space than a spare smartphone or two.</p><p> The output ports onboard include two 5V&#x2F;2.4A USB ports and a full AC plugin, which is turned on and off with a dedicated slider. All three can be used simultaneously if need be, but they also work independently if only one device needs to be charged.</p><p> We enjoyed the satin matte black finish of the ChargeTech battery pack as it makes it easy to hold onto without fear of dropping it, but it also holds onto fingerprints. This wasn’t a huge deal-breaker for us, but if you prefer your gadgets to be free of fingerprints, it’s something to keep in mind.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Yet-another-power-adapter"><a href="#Setup-Process-Yet-another-power-adapter" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Yet another power adapter"></a><strong>Setup Process: Yet another power adapter</strong></h2><p> Upon taking the ChargeTech 27000mAh out of its case, the first thing we noticed is the included accessories. In addition to the battery pack itself, ChargeTech includes a dedicated charger as well as an international travel<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-adapter-817585" >adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and accompanying case to carry it all in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pMX2VbLRSNxwb3iQ2XKJW_wDvKg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506_2-_8Web-5c9003a546e0fb000187a367.jpg"                      alt="Charge Tech"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> When it arrived, the battery pack was roughly 50% charged according to the onboard battery life indicator. So, as we do with all battery packs we test, we drained it completely and charged it.</p><p> While on the topic of charging, it’s worth noting the power input is a dedicated plugin that uses the included charger. It would’ve been nice to see ChargeTech use a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB Type-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> input, but that isn’t the case. Instead, the battery pack relies on an entirely separate charger that will take up even more space than a spare smartphone or two.</p><h2 id="Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Plenty-of-power-at-decent-speeds"><a href="#Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Plenty-of-power-at-decent-speeds" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed and Battery: Plenty of power at decent speeds"></a><strong>Charging Speed and Battery: Plenty of power at decent speeds</strong></h2><p> As mentioned above, we started the testing process by draining the ChargeTech 27000mAh entirely and charging it up. Over the course of the first charge and seven subsequent charges throughout testing, the battery pack averaged a charge time of approximately four and a half hours using the included charger.</p><p> For testing the ChargeTech 27000mAh, we used an iPhone XS and Samsung Galaxy S8 Active for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mobile-device-2373355" >mobile devices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a 2016 MacBook Pro 15-inch as the laptop of choice. With each device, we fully charged the battery pack and subsequently charged each device as many times as possible with a fully charged ChargeTech, making sure to drain the mobile device to zero before plugging it back in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zGJCf-e-sSLH4humuEfNXuJczUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506_2-_4Web-5c9003f146e0fb0001770117.jpg"                      alt="Charge Tech"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> The iPhone XS managed six and a half full charges with an average charge time of an hour and a half. The Samsung Galaxy S8 Active charged seven and a half times with an average charge time of an hour and a half as well. ChargeTech doesn’t provide guidelines on charge estimates, but the numbers line up with other testing we’ve done and reviews left on the Amazon product page.</p><p> As for the laptop, the ChargeTech battery pack charged our 2016 MacBook Pro 15-inch to nearly 95% with an average charge time of four and a half hours over the course of four charge cycles. This is on par with the Jackery PowerBar 77 in terms of times, but outperforms it, as the PowerBar 77 only ever achieved a 75% charge.</p><p> If capacity is your priority in a charger that also has an integrated AC plugin, the ChargeTech 27,000 will get the job done.</p><p> Something to keep in mind is charge times will vary greatly depending on how many devices are plugged in, the temperature, and whether or not you’re using devices while they’re charging.</p><h2 id="Price-A-little-bit-up-there"><a href="#Price-A-little-bit-up-there" class="headerlink" title="Price: A little bit up there"></a><strong>Price: A little bit up there</strong></h2><p> The ChargeTech 27000mAh battery pack retails for $199. Considering its capacity and included AC plugin, that’s a reasonable price. Not to mention it was nice to know we had a full laptop charge on the go, because carrying around the large power adapter isn’t exactly convenient.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111964/7443" target="_top" id="2111964">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111964" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111964/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Just-that-little-bit-extra"><a href="#Competition-Just-that-little-bit-extra" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Just that little bit extra"></a><strong>Competition: Just that little bit extra</strong></h2><p> The ChargeTech’s competition can be narrowed down to two main devices, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jackery-powerbar-battery-pack-review-4589480" >Jackery PowerBar 77 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the Omars battery pack. All three devices include an integrated AC plugin and all three devices are within 5,000mAh of battery capacity.</p><p> The Omars battery pack retails for $69.99, a full $130 less than the ChargeTech. However, it only has two USB ports onboard (not 2.4A) and its manufacturer specifically mentions it’s not compatible with Apple’s MacBook Pro 15-inch because its charging output is capped at 80W and the MacBook Pro draws 87W.</p><p> The PowerBar 77 retails for $129.99, a full $70 less than the ChargeTech. But, as mentioned above, it only charged our 2016 MacBook Pro 15-inch to 75% when completely dead compared to the ChargeTech’s 95% charge. The one area the Jackery has the ChargeTech beat is its USB Type-C charging port. Rather than carrying around a dedicated power adapter, the Jackery works with a cord you likely have in your bag already, which is a time and space saver.</p><p> Want to take a look at some other options?

But it won’t do it fast and it won’t impress you along the way. In our testing, it kind of just hummed along, charging at an adequate pace with a standard feature set. The additional power adapter was a pain and something well worth considering if portability is a concern of yours.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/maxoak-185wh-50000mah-battery-pack-review-4589398" >MaxOak 185Wh&#x2F;50000mAh Battery Pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/anker-powercore-26800-battery-pack-bundle-review-4589459" >Anker PowerCore+ 26800 Battery Pack Bundle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jetsun-16750mah-solar-power-bank-review-4690521" >JETSUN 16750mAh Solar Power Bank <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141680/17091" target="_top" id="2141680">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2141680" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141680/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  27000mAh Portable AC Battery Pack</li><li>Product Brand  ChargeTech</li><li>Price  $209.00</li><li>Release Date  June 2015</li><li>Weight  1.56 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.5 x 5.2 x 1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Removable Cables  Yes, included</li><li>Controls  AC power button</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs  AC outlet, two 2.4A USB ports</li><li>Warranty  One year</li><li>Compatibility  Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-todays-top-social-media-stars-a-look-at-8-hits/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Today's Top Social Media Stars A Look at 8 Hits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-conversion-rates-with-twitter-ads-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhancing Conversion Rates with Twitter Ads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-effortless-access-download-tactics-for-live-social-feeds/"><u>[New] In 2024, Effortless Access Download Tactics for Live Social Feeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-sparkling-ideas-crafting-creative-and-engaging-facebook-ads/"><u>[New] In 2024, Sparkling Ideas Crafting Creative and Engaging Facebook Ads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-videotweeteraudio-quick-audio-extractor/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved VideoTweeterAudio Quick Audio Extractor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-account-takeover-restoring-access-in-the-new-year/"><u>2024 Approved Account Takeover?

Being dragged through the media mud inspired the company to return to its cores and to offer a unique social media experience for all of its users once more. At the beginning of 2018, it became possible for the first time to <strong>record video calls on Facebook</strong> from an iPhone or iPad that has an iOS.11 or later version of the operating system installed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-facebook-video-calls.jpg"                      alt="record facebook video calls"                ></p><p>Facebook was also one of the first social media networks that started offering the live video call option back in 2011. In this article, we are going to provide screen recording solutions for Facebook video call and chat recording on different platforms, including Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS platforms, and we’ll show you how you can easily record video calls on Facebook.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Record Facebook Video Call on iPhone or iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android devices</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger</a></li></ul><h2 id="Method-1-The-Best-Way-to-Capture-Video-Calls-on-Mac-and-Windows-OS"><a href="#Method-1-The-Best-Way-to-Capture-Video-Calls-on-Mac-and-Windows-OS" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS"></a>Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS</h2><p>There are many different ways to record a Facebook video call on a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Macbook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or PC, but only a few of them are more efficient than using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Video Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Wondershare’s full-featured software provides a quick and easy way to record all your desktop activities in HD, even <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K video quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it also features a video editing mode where you can brush up your videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Filmora can record videos via the built-in or an external webcam record system audio and audio from an external source, which means you record videos using professional equipment. You can start a new screen recording session by clicking on the software’s desktop icon and selecting the Quick Capture mode from the software’s welcome window. Before each session, you should choose the area of the screen you want to record, change the video’s frame rate, and choose the video and audio capturing devices. After you’ve adjusted the settings for the screen recording session, you can start a video call on Facebook and then hit the Record button to start capturing the video.</p><p>Pause or stop recording at any moment by clicking on the appropriate buttons in the software’s toolbar or by using the Hotkey F10. Once the session is complete, the video file you’ve created will be opened in Filmora video editing mode. The software’s video editor offers transitions, cutting, and trimming tools, as well as a rich selection of annotations, filters, and effects. Filmora video editor supports nearly all popular input video file formats, but you can only export Facebook video calls as MP4 or MOV files. The software also enables you to capture videos on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Even though the devices that run on iOS 11 operating systems can record Facebook video calls, in theory, this feature has been inactive recently. The feature functions sporadically even on the iOS 13 version of the operating system. The App Store doesn’t offer too many choices for capturing screens on iPhones and iPads.</p><p>When you install the app on your device, you should enable the Mirroring option in the AirPlay app to project the screen of your iPhone to a computer. Then proceed to make a video call on Facebook and hit the record button displayed on the top of the screen you projected from your phone. The Appersoft app offers support for MP4, FLV, or GIF files, and it can capture footage in 1080p and 720p video resolution. You won’t be able to edit your videos with Appersoft, but the App Store offers a lot of great video editing apps at reasonable prices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087409/7443" target="_top" id="2087409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087409/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices"></a>Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices</h2><p>The Google Play Store provides a wide range of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording apps for Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and most of them feature enough screen recording tools to enable you to record a video call on Facebook. <strong>DU Recorder</strong> is one of the best options at your disposal because it is completely free and contains no in-app purchases.</p><p>The app lets you adjust frame rates, capture HD videos, and control the video recording settings from the notifications bar. The phone’s front camera can be used to record yourself speaking during the video call on Facebook, and you can also record external sound with the app. Du Recorder offers an alternative storage option that enables you to store Facebook video call recordings in your chosen location.</p><p>Besides being a powerful tool for capturing a screen of an Android device, this versatile app also offers video editing and live streaming services. The Du Recorder’s screen capturing mode can also produce GIF files, which can produce popular social media content.</p><h2 id="Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger"><a href="#Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger"></a>Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-videos-with-fb-messenger.jpg"                      alt="record videos with facebook messenger"                ></p><p>Android users can record all of their video calls from the Facebook Messenger app. You can start recording a video by launching the app and selecting the contact from the People With Messenger list in the Messanger tab. After you’ve selected the contact to whom the video will be sent, you should tap on the Camera button, located near the bottom of the screen, and then place your finger on the ‘Hold send button for video, tap for photo’ button and hold it there while recording the video. The video recording will stop once you lift your finger up and the video will be automatically sent to the contact you selected.</p><p>Using this method, a video captured with Facebook Messenger will not be saved on your Android phone, but you can change this setting and save all your Facebook video calls on your device’s SD card. Tap on your profile picture in the Facebook Messenger app, and find the ‘Photos, Videos, and Emoji’ menu.</p><p>The ‘Download Videos’ option in the ‘Photos, Videos and Emoji’ tab will be set on Wi-Fi Only by default, and you can activate the video download feature simply by tapping on the ON option in the ‘Download Videos’ window. You can disable this option whenever you want if the videos take too much of your phone’s memory by tapping on the OFF button, but the videos you download will play much smoother than the ones stored on the cloud.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Though it is convenient to record the Facebook video calls and chats, we recommend you inform the one who is calling you before recording the video.

We often find ourselves in a situation where we see something funny or interesting on YouTube and immediately want to share it on our Facebook.</p><p>We can easily share YouTube videos on Facebook. Here is the complete guide on sharing youtube videos on Facebook.</p><p>However, when you share something from YouTube to Facebook, it adds an embed link, and the video does not support autoplay on Facebook.</p><p>So, to help you avoid that problem, we will give you a step-by-step guide in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Turn Facebook Video Autoplay On&#x2F;Off?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?"></a>Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</h2><p>The YouTube videos that you share on Facebook do not play automatically.

In August, 2011 the facebook chat was replaced by Messenger but you can use Messenger even when you don’t have a facebook account. The app can be used on web, desktop and mobile apps, including Android and Apple, which makes it compatible with the Apple watch.</p><p>Essentially, Messenger is a texting app that allows you to text a person one-on-one or chat in a group. Upon all that messenger allows you to use emojis that reflect your emotions. But, the best part is how you can easily share videos, pictures and documents in Messenger.</p><p>Facebook Messenger comes with an array of great features including reacting on messages and media, read receipts, time stamps on messages, customizing your chat style etc.</p><p>Amongst all the fantastic features of Facebook Messenger, it collects all the media files you share in a chat and stores them in a single folder.

The grey badge verification request takes around 48 hours and the blue badge verification request needs around 3 to 45 days to receive the Facebook response. In case, your verification request is rejected, it is due to the following reasons.</p><pre><code>  * **Press releases or marketing is less** \- When your press is less, it is highly possible that your verification request is rejected as your business or page is not identified accurately. You must learn to get featured on Techcrunch, Forbes, etc. You can also [write a press release to get exposure](https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-press-releases-examples-templates/). You may also hire my digital marketing agency for the same.  * **Your Wikipedia is missing** \- In order to create a Wiki; you firstly require the high-quality press.  * **Your identity proof is not up to the mark** \- When your reason for verification request is not very compelling or the ID provided by you is blurry or inappropriate, your request may get rejected.  * **Missing Facebook Native Content** \- Facebook hates a dead page. So, it is important that your page is filled with relevant and great content for long.  * **Verification is Strict** \- Facebook only verifies the popular pages and profiles easily if you can establish your popularity. It is very strict on who they verify.</code></pre><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880931/19272" target="_top" id="1880931">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880931" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880931/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-3-Tips-to-Get-Facebook-Verification"><a href="#Part-5-3-Tips-to-Get-Facebook-Verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: 3 Tips to Get Facebook Verification"></a>Part 5: 3 Tips to Get Facebook Verification</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111995/7443" target="_top" id="2111995">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111995" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111995/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Provide-complete-and-detailed-information"><a href="#1-Provide-complete-and-detailed-information" class="headerlink" title="1.
