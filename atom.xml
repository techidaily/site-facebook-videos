Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see.

Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424531">                    <video width="864" height="NaN" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424531">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424531%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424531/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode.

The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option.

If your account is public, you will also have the other viewer option, which will show you the number of unknown people who viewed your story. But unfortunately, it doesn’t show you who they are.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I see how many times someone views my Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Currently, Facebook doesn’t have the feature to show how many times someone has viewed your Facebook story. The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option. You will have a list of people who checked your story.</p><ol><li><strong>How can I save someone’s Facebook Story after viewing it?</strong></li></ol><p>If you want to save someone’s Facebook story, you can get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Story Saver for a Facebook extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a Google Chrome extension. You need to download it and once it’s installed, just click on the story, and it will be saved and downloaded in the Download option.</p><ol><li><strong>Will people know if I viewed their Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, just like you can see who viewed your Facebook story, others can also check the same by clicking on the viewer option available on their story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-expertly-curated-facebooks-1-10-plays-for-2024/"><u>[New] Expertly Curated Facebook's #1-#10 Plays for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-live-demos-to-recordings-harness-ezvide-power/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Live Demos to Recordings Harness EZvide Power</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-navigating-the-dynamics-of-instagram-highlight-categories/"><u>[New] Navigating the Dynamics of Instagram Highlight Categories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-social-media-success-start-with-facebook-insights-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlocking Social Media Success Start with Facebook Insights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-identifying-your-one-of-a-kind-tiktok-sequence/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Identifying Your One-of-a-Kind TikTok Sequence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-streamline-your-strategy-with-aspect-ratio-mastery-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Streamline Your Strategy with Aspect Ratio Mastery on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-clear-and-compelling-1080p-streaming-on-the-social-network/"><u>[Updated] Clear and Compelling 1080P Streaming on the Social Network</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-master-meeting-magic-key-ways-to-tweak-with-zoom-converter/"><u>[Updated] Master Meeting Magic Key Ways to Tweak with Zoom Converter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-tactics-for-success-amidst-facebooks-algorithm-evolution/"><u>[Updated] Tactics for Success Amidst Facebook’s Algorithm Evolution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capture-cumulative-chronicles/"><u>2024 Approved Capture Cumulative Chronicles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-becoming-an-exclusive-guest-on-tiktok-live/"><u>In 2024, Becoming an Exclusive Guest on TikTok Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/ios-snapshot-spectrum-your-quick-reference-for-2024/"><u>IO's Snapshot Spectrum Your Quick Reference for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/students-new-tech-ally-asus-s15-oled-review-revealed/"><u>Students' New Tech Ally: Asus S15 OLED Review Revealed</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The cover page is the most creative spot where one can experience the richness and grab attention from the first time viewers or the audience becomes dashing if your FB account has a cover video. So, are there any other benefits by the usage of this Facebook page cover video? If this is your question from your side, here is a session, especially for you.</p><p>First of all, videos are the effective mediums that are eye-catching and attention-grabbers that can convey things in just seconds. While extensive data becomes impossible to reach the audience, Facebook cover videos become helpful portrayers that could deliver information easily-digestible dynamically. Instead of going through the about page, and album illustrating about oneself, your cover video would speak about you in seconds.</p><p>Second, if you are a business expert or service provider who wishes to get contacts and connect to people, these Facebook cover videos are of great assistance. You can showcase your products that could facilitate the selling of products, sharing them with others, leading to increased popularity and followers count. You can introduce your team, tour your location, and describe a service your office or organization offers.</p><p>You can also showcase your organization or company in the cover video. The most exceptional example is none other than the cover video by National Geographic. It has uploaded a scenery video as a point on advertising its newest magazine. This type of cover videos takes off a considerable audience crowd giving a magical touch.</p><p>Source: <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/natgeo/" >Facebook Page of National Geographic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Finally, besides products, service advertising, and business experts, these Facebook cover videos are beneficial to people who wish to showcase their talent. Are you an artist in art&#x2F;craft, singing expert, musician, or photographer? Facebook page cover videos are the best platforms for the world to know you and your talents.</p><h2 id="Facebook-Cover-Video-Specifications"><a href="#Facebook-Cover-Video-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Cover Video Specifications"></a>Facebook Cover Video Specifications</h2><p>Excited to know about the feature of FB cover video? Are you getting ready to upload one? Ensure that your cover video meets the below specification for successful accomplishment.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Uploading a cover video to your Facebook account is possible only through your desktop or computer.</p><p>Facebook allows uploading of cover videos, which are at least 20 but less than 90 seconds long. Videos beyond this time limit would result in the unsuccessful upload.</p><p>The resolution should meet 1080 Pixels for the bright appearance over the frame. Like cover propping done by Facebook is 820 * 462 pixels. Hence, align your video well so that all the essential images and text portraying your product&#x2F;talent get centralized within the frame.</p><p>Avoid awkward transitions as the cover photos will automatically be played off on the loop. Make sure that the video has started and ends with a natural loop. If looping isn’t possible, simply turn off the automatic replay option. If you are viewing the cover video from the computer, 75 pixels will get removed from the top and bottom; so, one has to click on it to view the full-dimensional one. But on the mobile, the full video is made visible.</p><p>For easy understanding and a clear demonstration, we have built-up the specifications in the form of a table below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Factor</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Time Limit</td><td>Between 20 and 90 seconds long</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Resolution</td><td>1080 Pixels</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Length</td><td>820*462 Pixels</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Minimum Dimension</td><td>820*312 Pixels</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Recommended Video Format</td><td>.mp4 or .mov</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Aspect Ratio</td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Width*Height</td><td>640*360 Pixels</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135471">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135471%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135471/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Upload-Your-Amazing-FB-Cover-Video"><a href="#How-to-Upload-Your-Amazing-FB-Cover-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload Your Amazing FB Cover Video?"></a>How to Upload Your Amazing FB Cover Video?</h2><p>Uploading a Facebook page cover video is as easy as uploading a photo to your story.

This means that you can’t add music to your Facebook profile on the web Facebook account. Instead, there are just a few simple steps that you need to follow to get started.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account using the iPhone, iPad, or Android Facebook application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will be taken to the feed page directly upon login in. You need to click on the profile picture that you can see on the top right.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you are there on your profile page, scroll down a bit, and you will see the Music tab. You need to tap on that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-option.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music Option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After you do that, you will be taken to the Song page.

This new feature rolled out a few years back. To find the add Music feature on your profile, you need to follow the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, launch your Facebook app and log in using your credentials. You will be taken to the feed page first. Once you are there, click on your profile to go to your profile page.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you are there on your profile, you need to scroll down a little, and you will see the Music tab.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the Music tab. Since it’s your first time using the Music feature, the Music page will be blank.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the + icon that you see on the top right, and the music search window will appear. You can search for the songs you like to add to your profile here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-feature.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music feature"                ></p><p>And that’s how the Music feature works on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Music makes this world better, and we agree with that.

Wondering how to make your videos better for your News Feed? Worry not, my friend! We have all the answers!</p><p>Just as we are mindful of the orientation of our pictures, similarly, we should focus on the orientation of our videos as well.</p><p>If you want to take a close-up of someone, you should use the portrait orientation; however, landscape orientation should be your go-to if you want a zoomed-out look. However, in the age of social media, you need to be mindful of where you will post the content.</p><p>This is because different social media platforms support different orientations, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-1.jpg"                      alt="Different Video Aspect Ratios on Mobile Devices"                ></p><p>So, for your Facebook videos, the ideal aspect ratio is 2:3.

Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment.

Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

You need to keep in mind that the maximum time limit for broadcasting on Facebook is 30 minutes.</p><p> 2. If you get trolled by other users while broadcasting or you don’t like the comments from a viewer then you can choose to block them from the broadcast. Just click on their profile pic which appears beside their comment and hit <strong>‘Block’</strong>.</p><p> 3. Before you go live on Facebook make sure that you have fast connection. Wi-fi works best for live broadcast on Facebook. If you don’t have wifi access then try using a 4G connection. Ideally you should check the speed of your net before you start broadcasting. For this you need to go to Google Play or App Store and download the Speedtest application.</p><p> 4. Once the broadcast is done the video is going to appear on your Facebook profile page and can be seen by your selected audience. However you can choose to remove the video at any time if your want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137411/7443" target="_top" id="2137411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-expert-fb-video-sharing-tactics-for-desktop-and-handheld-devices/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Expert FB Video Sharing Tactics for Desktop and Handheld Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-how-to-create-insta-highlight-cover-photos-an-ultimate-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Create Insta Highlight Cover Photos An Ultimate Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-maximizing-audience-reach-sharing-twitch-live/"><u>[New] In 2024, Maximizing Audience Reach Sharing Twitch Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-tracing-treasure-trails-fast-friending-fundamentals/"><u>[New] In 2024, Tracing Treasure Trails Fast Friending Fundamentals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-optimal-viewing-angles-for-fb-videos/"><u>[New] Optimal Viewing Angles for FB Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-network-nirvana-access-resurrected/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Network Nirvana Access Resurrected</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-efficient-facebook-video-extraction-procedures/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Efficient Facebook Video Extraction Procedures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-perfect-your-youtube-experience-add-timestamps-efficiently/"><u>[Updated] Perfect Your YouTube Experience Add Timestamps Efficiently</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-picks-best-6-fb-lite-videos/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Picks Best 6 FB Lite Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/2023s-best-fb-link-exporters-available-for-free-online/"><u>2023'S Best FB Link Exporters - Available for FREE Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/beat-the-glitches-essential-tips-to-stop-diablo-immortal-from-crashing-on-pc-updated-for-2n4/"><u>Beat the Glitches: Essential Tips to Stop Diablo Immortal From Crashing on PC (Updated for 2N4)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/complete-guide-on-unlocking-apple-iphone-6-with-a-broken-screen-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Complete Guide on Unlocking Apple iPhone 6 with a Broken Screen?

You can show a different world to all your viewers with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360 videos and photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> You will be glad to know that Facebook is now compatible with VR headsets that were earlier limited to Oculus Rift etc. It is time to get started with new experience to enjoy 360 videos on your own Facebook Profile.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is 360 Video</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Make 360 Video for Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Upload 360 Video to Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Facebook 360 Video &amp; Gear VR</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-360-Degree-Video"><a href="#What-is-360-Degree-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is 360 Degree Video?"></a>What is 360 Degree Video?</h2><p> Most of the cameras these days are capable enough to capture shoots with 170 degree wide coverage and in case if you want to show the scene behind the camera then it becomes essential to use two 170 degree FOV cameras back to back. Hence, for capturing all six directions in a single footage you may require connecting 6 cameras together while adjusting their focus in different directions. The resultant content is known as 360 degree video. Many smart algorithms have been developed by professionals to get these videos stitched together to develop complete 360 degree content in a single footage. This is something like standing in the centre of a sphere and viewing everything in all directions.</p><p> These 360 degree videos have inspired the concept of virtual reality but these equipments are quite expensive.
