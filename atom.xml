Nowadays any iOS user can take stunning 360 degree photos on their iPhone and iPad and upload them directly on Facebook. If you are an iPhone user who is wondering how to create 360 degree photos and videos should keep reading this article where we are going to explain you everything about capturing 360 degrees pictures and videos.</p><h2 id="How-to-take-360-videos-from-your-iPad-and-iPhone-without-any-additional-hardware-for-FB"><a href="#How-to-take-360-videos-from-your-iPad-and-iPhone-without-any-additional-hardware-for-FB" class="headerlink" title="How to take 360 videos from your iPad and iPhone without any additional hardware for FB"></a>How to take 360 videos from your iPad and iPhone without any additional hardware for FB</h2><p> The introduction of a variety of VR headsets along with a range of cameras with 360 degree video shooting ability is a clear indicator of the fact that the future lies with Virtual Reality. However not all tech enthusiasts would be able to afford these super expensive cameras. This might lead one to believe that 360 degree videos aren’t for people like you and me. However, this is not the fact. In the last few years Apple has enhanced the iPhone cameras to a great extent and these days you can use your iPhone to create casual 360 degree videos. Keep reading to find out the easiest way to capture 360 degree videos on your iPad and iPhone with the help of Splash 360. The best part is that you can do it without spending on any additional hardware.</p><h4 id="Splash"><a href="#Splash" class="headerlink" title="Splash"></a>Splash</h4><p> This is an all new application for iPhone which would help you come up with superb 360 degree photos and videos. It is incredible that Splash has created an application which would allow the users to capture up to 10 videos of 2 seconds duration and then stitch them together to create a new video. All this can be done on your smartphone. It goes without saying that the best part of this application is that you can download it for free. With the help of Splash you will be able to directly upload all your photos and videos on Facebook or share them with your friends through a link. The Splash app also comes with full support for Google Cardboard headsets which would let you fully concentrate in the 360 degree environment.</p><h4 id="Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone"><a href="#Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Capturing with Splash on iPhone"></a>Capturing with Splash on iPhone</h4><p> Shooting 360 degree videos on Splash is almost child play and it can be mastered even by novices. Let’s take a step by step look at how to shoot 360 degree videos with Splash.</p><ul><li>Open the Splash app and you will be able to see a green button with a camera icon in the home page. Tapping this green button would allow the application to capture videos from the camera of your iPhone.</li><li>In the video interface of the Splash app you will be able to capture a 360 degree video just like capturing a panorama. All you need to do is point the phone at the position where you want to start and the press the shutter button and hold it for shooting the video. Now you can change the position of your camera in whichever way you want and keep recording till you have finished shooting the sphere.</li><li>When you have recorded all the angles by rotating the camera of your iPhone you need to hit the green checkmark.</li><li>In case you are not looking forward to capturing the entire sphere you can always choose to stop shooting midway.</li><li>Lastly you need to save your work before you hit the share button. The sharing option list is right there on the screen- all you have to do is just single tap on it and post your creation wherever you want.</li></ul><p> Tips: Like any other 360 degree recording application which is dependent on the movement of the phone for capturing an entire sphere, the video quality of Splash is going to depend on the stability of the phone while shooting. Therefore make sure not to move much while shooting. No matter how hard you try to keep your hands steady there is surely going to be a few jerks. This is precisely why you need to use a small tripod where you can position the phone and rotate it. Using a tripod is the safest bet since it not only ensures better stability but also gives you enhanced video quality.</p><h2 id="Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens"><a href="#Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens"></a>Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens</h2><p> If you want to create a stunning 360 degree video with your iOS mobile device then you need to make use of an all new 3K 360 degree camera called Insta360 Nano. Insta360 Nano which is available for less than $200 on Amazon is one of the cheapest devices for capturing real cool 360 degree videos. It can also be used as a standalone 360 degree cam which just needs to be connected with your iPhone for viewing your captures, tweaking the settings and for getting a live preview.</p><h4 id="Capturing-with-Insta360-on-iPhone"><a href="#Capturing-with-Insta360-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Capturing with Insta360 on iPhone"></a>Capturing with Insta360 on iPhone</h4><ul><li>To capture a video&#x2F;photo just connect the Insta360 Nano to your iPhone via lightning.</li><li>Now launch the app and hit the shutter button to shoot. Make sure to keep your camera as still as possible for best results.</li><li>Another way is to insert a Micro SD card into the TF card slot at the bottom of the Insta360 Nano and hit the shutter when the LED turns green in colour.</li></ul><h4 id="Sharing-on-FB"><a href="#Sharing-on-FB" class="headerlink" title="Sharing on FB"></a>Sharing on FB</h4><ul><li>In order to share your captured video you need to hit the Share icon on the top right of the interface.</li><li>Now choose the option which would allow you to export it as a panorama.</li><li>After the export is complete just open the Facebook app and hit the option for uploading photos and videos before uploading your 360 degree file.</li><li>Now just select your hashtags and captions and your 360 capture can be viewed by all your friends and followers.</li></ul><p> If your upload doesn’t go right the first time you need to delete your draft and re-upload it. Since Facebook itself does the job of stitching your 360 degree video together, uploading it can take quite some time. Usually a 20 second clip takes about 5-10 minutes to upload. Your video would appear with a 360 logo on the newsfeed of your friends so as to encourage viewers to enjoy this new 360 degree experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-step-by-step-approach-to-fb-video-retrieval/"><u>2024 Approved  A Step-by-Step Approach to FB Video Retrieval</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-masterfb-mp4-the-ultimate-downloader-for-vids/"><u>In 2024, MasterFB-MP4  The Ultimate Downloader for Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-firefoxs-prime-expert-downloads-and-addons-navigating-facebook-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Firefox's Prime  Expert Downloads & Addons Navigating Facebook Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enhancing-visual-aesthetics-adding-black-bar-and-box-to-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Enhancing Visual Aesthetics  Adding Black Bar & Box to Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-social-sea-comprehensive-30-tips-for-success/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating the Social Sea  Comprehensive 30 Tips for Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-guiding-users-on-completely-audible-fb-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Guiding Users on Completely Audible FB Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-setting-the-stage-for-seamless-video-playback-in-facebook-network/"><u>In 2024, Setting the Stage for Seamless Video Playback in Facebook Network</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/tunetracker-outside-of-dacast-realm/"><u>TuneTracker  Outside of DaCast Realm</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-novice-to-money-maker-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Novice to Money-Maker on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-from-video-to-audio-a-guide-to-youtube-downloading-for-2024/"><u>Updated From Video to Audio A Guide to YouTube Downloading for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-what-i-look-for-in-a-video-to-audio-conversion-software/"><u>New 2024 Approved What I Look for in a Video to Audio Conversion Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/hard-resetting-an-samsung-galaxy-f04-device-made-easy-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Hard Resetting an Samsung Galaxy F04 Device Made Easy | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-purifying-audio-from-films-and-movies-cost-effective-methods/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Purifying Audio From Films and Movies  Cost-Effective Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-pursuing-prolonged-iphone-night-sky-captures/"><u>[Updated] Pursuing Prolonged iPhone Night Sky Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-next-gen-windows-capture-tech/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Next-Gen Windows Capture Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-synchronization-between-cameras-and-obs-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Synchronization Between Cameras and OBS for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

But if you are here on this page then probably you are going to break all rules now and are thinking to jump to Facebook platform with an eye catching profile. That’s a great idea. Facebook is available for free and its interactive user interface will make everything fun for you. I must add, this is the best platform to stay connected with all your near and dear ones.</p><p> So, follow these guidelines to get started with a new Facebook account.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Facebook-Account-1"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Facebook-Account-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Facebook Account"></a>How to Create a Facebook Account</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Sign-Up"><a href="#Step-1-Sign-Up" class="headerlink" title="Step 1.Sign Up"></a>Step 1.Sign Up</h4><p> The very first step is to open &lt;<a href="http://www.facebook.com>">www.facebook.com&gt;</a> on your web browser and then hit Create account option. It will ask for your basic information, simple add your real name in the space provided with two fields: First name and Last name. For the security reasons you may have to prove your identity so always prefer to create Facebook account with real name only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-create-account.jpg"                      alt="facebook create account"                ></p><p> Then enter your accurate and working mobile number or users can also prefer to update their email ID.

It is important to start with privacy settings first and add controls about who can view your profile or updates. To do this, move to settings option available on top bar below an arrow at right hand side portion of screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-settings-option.jpg"                      alt="facebook settings option"                ></p><p> A new settings window will open and you will find so many options in a navigation pane located at left hand side.

Connect to the Pain of your Target Audience</strong></p><p>The first step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to connect with the pain of your target audience. What problem are they trying to solve? What need do they have that your product or service can fill?</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to speak to the pain of being overweight or feeling self-conscious about one’s appearance.</p><p><strong>#2. Introduce the Solution</strong></p><p>Once you’ve connected with the pain of your target audience, you can introduce the solution that your product or service provides. This is where you talk about what your product or service can do for them.</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to talk about how your product can help them to lose weight and feel more confident.</p><p><strong>#3. Call to Action</strong></p><p>The last step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to include a call to action. This is where you tell the reader what you want them to do next. Do you want them to click on your ad, visit your website, or purchase your product? Make sure your call to action is clear and concise.</p><p>For example, if you want the reader to click on your ad, you might say something like “Click here to learn more about our weight loss product.”</p><p><strong>Example of Facebook ads Creative Image</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/creative-facebook-ads-example.jpg"                      alt="creative facebook ads example"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three simple structures for creating a creative image for your Facebook Ads, it’s time to get started!

Wondering how to make your videos better for your News Feed? Worry not, my friend! We have all the answers!</p><p>Just as we are mindful of the orientation of our pictures, similarly, we should focus on the orientation of our videos as well.</p><p>If you want to take a close-up of someone, you should use the portrait orientation; however, landscape orientation should be your go-to if you want a zoomed-out look. However, in the age of social media, you need to be mindful of where you will post the content.</p><p>This is because different social media platforms support different orientations, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-1.jpg"                      alt="Different Video Aspect Ratios on Mobile Devices"                ></p><p>So, for your Facebook videos, the ideal aspect ratio is 2:3. However, let’s take a closer look and see what works best for you; horizontal video or vertical Facebook video?</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">Bonus Tip! How to Make Horizontal or Vertical Video Using Wondershare Filmora.</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Choose-Vertical-Video-or-Horizontal-Video-for-Facebook"><a href="#Part-1-Choose-Vertical-Video-or-Horizontal-Video-for-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well.

Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see. Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

[4 Ways]"></a>Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously? [4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode"></a>Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode</h3><p>When you turn on the airplane mode of your device, your phone will no longer be connected to the internet. So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline"                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option. Please click on that. Two options will be available: deactivate your account and delete your account. You need to click on the deactivate option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deactivate-facebook-account.jpg"                      alt="deactivate FB account to View Facebok Story anonymously"                ></p><p>Once 24 hours is over, you can log in to reactive your account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?"></a>Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?</h2><p>There are three easy ways to see someone’s story on Facebook.

If your account is public, you will also have the other viewer option, which will show you the number of unknown people who viewed your story. But unfortunately, it doesn’t show you who they are.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I see how many times someone views my Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Currently, Facebook doesn’t have the feature to show how many times someone has viewed your Facebook story. The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option. You will have a list of people who checked your story.</p><ol><li><strong>How can I save someone’s Facebook Story after viewing it?</strong></li></ol><p>If you want to save someone’s Facebook story, you can get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Story Saver for a Facebook extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a Google Chrome extension. You need to download it and once it’s installed, just click on the story, and it will be saved and downloaded in the Download option.</p><ol><li><strong>Will people know if I viewed their Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, just like you can see who viewed your Facebook story, others can also check the same by clicking on the viewer option available on their story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-tackle-intermittent-fb-reels-display/"><u>[Updated] Tackle Intermittent FB Reels Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-twitter-live-sound-solving-partially-muted-audio-issues/"><u>[Updated] Twitter Live Sound  Solving Partially Muted Audio Issues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-audience-engagement-excellence-spreading-stories-on-facebook/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Audience Engagement Excellence  Spreading Stories on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-understanding-the-meaning-of-facebooks-blue-emoji/"><u>In 2024, Understanding the Meaning of Facebook's Blue Emoji</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-immersion-mixing-tunes-in-facebook-narratives/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Instant Immersion  Mixing Tunes in Facebook Narratives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-net-booster-fb-stories-repository-app/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Net Booster  FB Stories Repository App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-bring-past-videos-into-the-present-on-social-media-platforms-for-2024/"><u>How to Bring Past Videos Into the Present on Social Media Platforms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/epoch-elucidators-academy-top-ten-titans/"><u>Epoch Elucidators Academy - Top Ten Titans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-interpreting-single-photos-as-video-chronicles/"><u>[New] In 2024, Interpreting Single Photos as Video Chronicles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-ground-to-heavens-a-mobile-panorama-journey/"><u>2024 Approved  From Ground to Heavens  A Mobile Panorama Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-artisans-guide-to-flawless-skype-calls-capture-and-storage/"><u>In 2024, The Artisan's Guide to Flawless Skype Calls Capture and Storage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-mobile-and-professional-cameras-producing-igtv-excellence/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering Mobile and Professional Cameras  Producing IGTV Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://meme-emoji.techidaily.com/new-how-to-record-and-edit-an-animoji-or-memoji-karaoke-music-video-in-2024/"><u>New How to Record and Edit an Animoji or Memoji Karaoke Music Video, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-to-finding-your-apple-id-on-your-iphone-7-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, A Step-by-Step Guide to Finding Your Apple ID On Your iPhone 7 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-on-zte-nubia-flip-5g-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 4 Methods to Turn off Life 360 On ZTE Nubia Flip 5G without Anyone Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It will ask for your basic information, simple add your real name in the space provided with two fields: First name and Last name. For the security reasons you may have to prove your identity so always prefer to create Facebook account with real name only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-create-account.jpg"                      alt="facebook create account"                ></p><p> Then enter your accurate and working mobile number or users can also prefer to update their email ID.
