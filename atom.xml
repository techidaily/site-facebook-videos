You have to find the right type of content that people will share with their friends. We all know that some posts are more likely than others to get shared on social media—but what makes them so clickable? Well, there are several different types of Facebook-ready material out there in the world:</p><h2 id="Contests-and-Giveaways"><a href="#Contests-and-Giveaways" class="headerlink" title="Contests and Giveaways"></a>Contests and Giveaways</h2><p>Contests and giveaways are a great way to get people to engage with your page. While it’s important to make sure that the contest is fun, easy, and not too much work for you, you should also think about what kind of prizes would be relevant and interesting to people who visit your page.</p><p>Remember: giveaways should be something people want! A good prize will help attract more participation in the contest and create buzz around your brand.</p><p>Contest Alert from Enchanted Kingdom is the perfect Facebook contest idea to generate excitement for their upcoming events.</p><h2 id="Your-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Life Events"></a>Your Life Events</h2><p>As a business owner, you want to create a buzz on Facebook. You’ve tried posting ads and boosting posts, but that doesn’t seem to be working for you. The answer is simple: post about your life events!</p><p>You don’t have to be an attendee of someone else’s wedding or send out birth announcements every time one of your family members gives birth; however, if you have something exciting going on in your life (or even just funny stories) there are plenty of opportunities for viral content.</p><p>These types of posts can really boost the engagement on your page because they show off the human side of being a business owner—you’re not just posting about how great your services are; people get excited when they see that their favorite barista had a baby or experienced some kind of major success in life.</p><p>A great example of a life event post is when Mark Zuckerberg’s post is coming baby with Priscilla Chan. When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and Priscilla Chan are going to have a baby, the reaction from the audience ranged anywhere between congratulations and excitement for their future kid. The post has since gone viral with over 1.3 reactions!</p><h2 id="Your-Company’s-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Company’s-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Company’s Life Events"></a>Your Company’s Life Events</h2><ul><li>Share milestones and achievements. This is one of the easiest ways to create a buzz on Facebook. No matter if you’re celebrating a major accomplishment or simply adding a new employee to your team, highlight it! Has some sort of contest or giveaway that encourages fans to join in on the celebration (i.e., “Like this post if you want us to throw you a party”).</li><li>Share news about your company. Stay connected with customers by sharing news and updates regarding your company, products, services, and more – especially if they are relevant to what people are talking about in their social networks at that time (i.e., Trending Topics). For example: “Want a sneak peek at our upcoming product launch? Click here.” If there’s something going on in your industry that’s creating buzz throughout social networks, be sure not only to talk about it but also show how it relates back to what makes your business special&#x2F;different from everyone else out there!</li></ul><p>Take a look at Ford’s post about their Media’s Awards Choice in the years 2020-2021. It features the Ford Ranger and Ford Mustang. It’s a great post if you’re interested in cars.</p><h2 id="Seasonal-and-Holiday-Posts"><a href="#Seasonal-and-Holiday-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Seasonal and Holiday Posts"></a>Seasonal and Holiday Posts</h2><ul><li>Use the holiday to your advantage. While you may not be able to get in on the actual celebrations, you can still use the holidays and seasonal content to your advantage. For example, if it’s Halloween time, consider posting pictures from last year’s party! People love nostalgia and will share those posts with their friends in no time.</li><li>Create a holiday giveaway or contest. Customers love free stuff! Create a competition that includes everyone; even if someone does not win anything valuable (although this is always appreciated), they will still feel appreciated for joining your page because they were given the chance at receiving something nice as well as help out their favorite business by spreading awareness about it through social media sharing of their own.</li></ul><p>Check this Mother’s Day post from Mason Cash with their mechanics of Like, Follow &amp; comment to win a Mother’s Day bundle worth over $75.</p><h2 id="Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist"><a href="#Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist" class="headerlink" title="Classic Photos with a Twist"></a>Classic Photos with a Twist</h2><p>One way to get your photo on the front page of Facebook is with a classic picture. But you can’t just post any old photo and hope for the best. You need to make sure that the image looks as good as possible, and it needs to be relevant to your business or brand.</p><p>While most people think of their feed as a place where they’ll see pictures of friends and family, there are plenty of opportunities here for businesses too—if they know what they’re doing. A good caption will also help keep your audience engaged by adding value to the photo; don’t go overboard with hashtags though, because that’s one way of making it harder for people who aren’t following you yet (or who have never heard of you) from finding this information later on down the line when they decide whether or not they want something from your store&#x2F;organization&#x2F;etcetera.”</p><p>The photo of this simple yet creative picture with 308 reactions, 55 comments, and 13 shares from Lenovo is one among many examples of a classic photo with a twist post.</p><h2 id="Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos"><a href="#Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos" class="headerlink" title="Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)"></a>Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)</h2><p>Photos of animals are the most popular content on Facebook and for good reason. They’re cute! They’re funny! And they make you feel things—maybe even happy or inspired. In other words, they’re relatable in a way that other posts aren’t.</p><p>There’s also the fact that photos of animals can be used to promote your brand in subtle ways. For example, if you have an animal-related product or business (cat food company), then including cats in your photos will attract cat lovers who might not otherwise follow you on social media.</p><p>Check out one of the amazing Subaru of America, Inc. commercials featuring one of Golden Meadows puppies, Amber, learning how to parallel park!</p><h2 id="Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring"><a href="#Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring" class="headerlink" title="Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring"></a>Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring</h2><p>The best way to get likes, comments, and shares on your Facebook page is by posting high-quality content that people will want to share with their friends. The reason why a post goes viral on Facebook is that it’s either informative or entertaining.</p><ul><li>For inspiration: Post something that motivates the reader and makes them feel good about themselves or their life situation. You can do this in many ways such as sharing quotes from famous people, funny videos or photos, etc.</li><li>For fun: Post things that make the readers laugh like funny photos, memes or cartoons&#x2F;drawings of characters from popular movies&#x2F;cartoon series like Pokemon Go! Which has become a global phenomenon!</li></ul><p><strong>BONUS:</strong> Wondershare Filmora can help you to create stunning videos that can go viral.</p><p>With <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, anyone can create stunning videos that are sure to capture the attention of the online world.

Wondering how to make your videos better for your News Feed? Worry not, my friend! We have all the answers!</p><p>Just as we are mindful of the orientation of our pictures, similarly, we should focus on the orientation of our videos as well.</p><p>If you want to take a close-up of someone, you should use the portrait orientation; however, landscape orientation should be your go-to if you want a zoomed-out look. However, in the age of social media, you need to be mindful of where you will post the content.</p><p>This is because different social media platforms support different orientations, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-1.jpg"                      alt="Different Video Aspect Ratios on Mobile Devices"                ></p><p>So, for your Facebook videos, the ideal aspect ratio is 2:3.

Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment.

Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos.

Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Wondering how to make your videos better for your News Feed? Worry not, my friend! We have all the answers!</p><p>Just as we are mindful of the orientation of our pictures, similarly, we should focus on the orientation of our videos as well.</p><p>If you want to take a close-up of someone, you should use the portrait orientation; however, landscape orientation should be your go-to if you want a zoomed-out look. However, in the age of social media, you need to be mindful of where you will post the content.</p><p>This is because different social media platforms support different orientations, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-1.jpg"                      alt="Different Video Aspect Ratios on Mobile Devices"                ></p><p>So, for your Facebook videos, the ideal aspect ratio is 2:3. However, let’s take a closer look and see what works best for you; horizontal video or vertical Facebook video?</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">Bonus Tip!

Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Boosting-Your-Presence-on-FB-with-Virality-Techniques"><a href="#Boosting-Your-Presence-on-FB-with-Virality-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Boosting Your Presence on FB with Virality Techniques"></a>Boosting Your Presence on FB with Virality Techniques</h2><p>If you want your Facebook page to go viral, it’s not enough to just post content. You have to find the right type of content that people will share with their friends. We all know that some posts are more likely than others to get shared on social media—but what makes them so clickable? Well, there are several different types of Facebook-ready material out there in the world:</p><h2 id="Contests-and-Giveaways"><a href="#Contests-and-Giveaways" class="headerlink" title="Contests and Giveaways"></a>Contests and Giveaways</h2><p>Contests and giveaways are a great way to get people to engage with your page. While it’s important to make sure that the contest is fun, easy, and not too much work for you, you should also think about what kind of prizes would be relevant and interesting to people who visit your page.</p><p>Remember: giveaways should be something people want! A good prize will help attract more participation in the contest and create buzz around your brand.</p><p>Contest Alert from Enchanted Kingdom is the perfect Facebook contest idea to generate excitement for their upcoming events.</p><h2 id="Your-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Life Events"></a>Your Life Events</h2><p>As a business owner, you want to create a buzz on Facebook. You’ve tried posting ads and boosting posts, but that doesn’t seem to be working for you. The answer is simple: post about your life events!</p><p>You don’t have to be an attendee of someone else’s wedding or send out birth announcements every time one of your family members gives birth; however, if you have something exciting going on in your life (or even just funny stories) there are plenty of opportunities for viral content.</p><p>These types of posts can really boost the engagement on your page because they show off the human side of being a business owner—you’re not just posting about how great your services are; people get excited when they see that their favorite barista had a baby or experienced some kind of major success in life.</p><p>A great example of a life event post is when Mark Zuckerberg’s post is coming baby with Priscilla Chan. When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and Priscilla Chan are going to have a baby, the reaction from the audience ranged anywhere between congratulations and excitement for their future kid. The post has since gone viral with over 1.3 reactions!</p><h2 id="Your-Company’s-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Company’s-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Company’s Life Events"></a>Your Company’s Life Events</h2><ul><li>Share milestones and achievements. This is one of the easiest ways to create a buzz on Facebook. No matter if you’re celebrating a major accomplishment or simply adding a new employee to your team, highlight it! Has some sort of contest or giveaway that encourages fans to join in on the celebration (i.e., “Like this post if you want us to throw you a party”).</li><li>Share news about your company. Stay connected with customers by sharing news and updates regarding your company, products, services, and more – especially if they are relevant to what people are talking about in their social networks at that time (i.e., Trending Topics). For example: “Want a sneak peek at our upcoming product launch? Click here.” If there’s something going on in your industry that’s creating buzz throughout social networks, be sure not only to talk about it but also show how it relates back to what makes your business special&#x2F;different from everyone else out there!</li></ul><p>Take a look at Ford’s post about their Media’s Awards Choice in the years 2020-2021. It features the Ford Ranger and Ford Mustang. It’s a great post if you’re interested in cars.</p><h2 id="Seasonal-and-Holiday-Posts"><a href="#Seasonal-and-Holiday-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Seasonal and Holiday Posts"></a>Seasonal and Holiday Posts</h2><ul><li>Use the holiday to your advantage. While you may not be able to get in on the actual celebrations, you can still use the holidays and seasonal content to your advantage. For example, if it’s Halloween time, consider posting pictures from last year’s party! People love nostalgia and will share those posts with their friends in no time.</li><li>Create a holiday giveaway or contest. Customers love free stuff! Create a competition that includes everyone; even if someone does not win anything valuable (although this is always appreciated), they will still feel appreciated for joining your page because they were given the chance at receiving something nice as well as help out their favorite business by spreading awareness about it through social media sharing of their own.</li></ul><p>Check this Mother’s Day post from Mason Cash with their mechanics of Like, Follow &amp; comment to win a Mother’s Day bundle worth over $75.</p><h2 id="Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist"><a href="#Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist" class="headerlink" title="Classic Photos with a Twist"></a>Classic Photos with a Twist</h2><p>One way to get your photo on the front page of Facebook is with a classic picture. But you can’t just post any old photo and hope for the best. You need to make sure that the image looks as good as possible, and it needs to be relevant to your business or brand.</p><p>While most people think of their feed as a place where they’ll see pictures of friends and family, there are plenty of opportunities here for businesses too—if they know what they’re doing. A good caption will also help keep your audience engaged by adding value to the photo; don’t go overboard with hashtags though, because that’s one way of making it harder for people who aren’t following you yet (or who have never heard of you) from finding this information later on down the line when they decide whether or not they want something from your store&#x2F;organization&#x2F;etcetera.”</p><p>The photo of this simple yet creative picture with 308 reactions, 55 comments, and 13 shares from Lenovo is one among many examples of a classic photo with a twist post.</p><h2 id="Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos"><a href="#Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos" class="headerlink" title="Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)"></a>Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)</h2><p>Photos of animals are the most popular content on Facebook and for good reason. They’re cute! They’re funny! And they make you feel things—maybe even happy or inspired. In other words, they’re relatable in a way that other posts aren’t.</p><p>There’s also the fact that photos of animals can be used to promote your brand in subtle ways. For example, if you have an animal-related product or business (cat food company), then including cats in your photos will attract cat lovers who might not otherwise follow you on social media.</p><p>Check out one of the amazing Subaru of America, Inc. commercials featuring one of Golden Meadows puppies, Amber, learning how to parallel park!</p><h2 id="Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring"><a href="#Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring" class="headerlink" title="Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring"></a>Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring</h2><p>The best way to get likes, comments, and shares on your Facebook page is by posting high-quality content that people will want to share with their friends. The reason why a post goes viral on Facebook is that it’s either informative or entertaining.</p><ul><li>For inspiration: Post something that motivates the reader and makes them feel good about themselves or their life situation. You can do this in many ways such as sharing quotes from famous people, funny videos or photos, etc.</li><li>For fun: Post things that make the readers laugh like funny photos, memes or cartoons&#x2F;drawings of characters from popular movies&#x2F;cartoon series like Pokemon Go! Which has become a global phenomenon!</li></ul><p><strong>BONUS:</strong> Wondershare Filmora can help you to create stunning videos that can go viral.</p><p>With <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, anyone can create stunning videos that are sure to capture the attention of the online world.

We believe that hashtags on Facebook are a very useful tool for marketers as they can help you attract influencers and followers. This article will go into detail about the best way to use Facebook hashtags.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Why You Should Use Facebook Hashtags</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 3: How to Use Facebook Hashtags Properly</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Why-You-Should-Use-Facebook-Hashtags"><a href="#Part-1-Why-You-Should-Use-Facebook-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why You Should Use Facebook Hashtags"></a>Part 1: Why You Should Use Facebook Hashtags</h2><h3 id="1-Hashtags-Connect-Your-Content"><a href="#1-Hashtags-Connect-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="1. Hashtags Connect Your Content"></a>1. Hashtags Connect Your Content</h3><p> The reason why it is so useful to use hashtags on Facebook is because they will help you connect your content with other people who may be interested in what you have to say. It is likely that other people are posting about similar topics, products or services.</p><p> Hashtags lets you form a connection with those people. Your content is easily accessible with hashtags, as anyone who is browsing through the current posts on that hashtag will see your posts.</p><h3 id="2-Expand-Your-Reach"><a href="#2-Expand-Your-Reach" class="headerlink" title="2. Expand Your Reach"></a>2. Expand Your Reach</h3><p> Using hashtags is a win-win approach on Facebook. There is no downside associated with adding a couple hashtags to every Facebook post. And the upside is huge.</p><p> A hashtag delivers expanded reach on the platform. A previous post would only be seen by followers or those who specifically search for your business name on the platform. Hashtags ensure that anyone clicking on a hashtag and browsing through the feed may come across your content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-You-Should-Know-About-Hashtags"><a href="#Part-2-What-You-Should-Know-About-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags"></a>Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags</h2><p> Hashtags are a concept that first started on Twitter, where individuals were able to add a # before writing a word or phrase. The hashtag is a searchable device on these social media platforms, as a person is able to click on the hashtag and see other posts that include it as well.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/using-hashtags-on-facebook" >Every hashtag that is created on Facebook has its own URL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When someone clicks on the hashtag, they immediately go to that page, where they can see other posts from the same hashtag.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Facebook-Hashtags-Properly"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Facebook-Hashtags-Properly" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Facebook Hashtags Properly"></a>Part 3: How to Use Facebook Hashtags Properly</h2><h3 id="1-Use-Popular-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Popular-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Popular Hashtags"></a>1. Use Popular Hashtags</h3><p> The first rule to succeeding with hashtags is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamtechie.com/2013/05/an-update-on-facebook-and-hashtags/" >use ones that are already very popular <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These are branded or social community hashtags that everyone uses on a regular basis.</p><p> For instance, a hashtag such as #MotivationMonday is a common example of a popular hashtag. But a company could also use a single hashtag for all its posts, creating a branded hashtag. As the company becomes more popular, the usefulness of that hashtag would increase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-facebook-hashtags.JPG"                      alt="popular facebook hashtag"                ></p><h3 id="2-Cross-Social-Performance"><a href="#2-Cross-Social-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Cross Social Performance"></a>2. Cross Social Performance</h3><p> A useful side effect of Facebook adding hashtags is that you can now create more posts that are applicable to all the major social networks. Hashtags are used on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.</p><p> The same promotional post can go out on each site. It would have great performance as the hashtags you are using would be popular on all of those sites.</p><p> But it is important to use some caution with using the same posts for all your social accounts. For instance, posts that are image or video-centric are better for Instagram, while posting links is more useful on Twitter and Facebook.</p><h3 id="3-Promote-Special-Events"><a href="#3-Promote-Special-Events" class="headerlink" title="3. Promote Special Events"></a>3. Promote Special Events</h3><p> When there is a special promotion, event or landmark associated with a business, using a hashtag for that occasion can be very helpful. A business that is having a sale, for example, could use a hashtag such as #discounts to indicate that fact. Anyone who is searching for that hashtag would see the post!</p><p> Hashtags are also useful for contests. While you cannot have someone enter a contest through a hashtag because of Facebook rules, it is helpful in letting more people know about the contest.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings"><a href="#Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings"></a>Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings</h2><p> Facebook has privacy settings that can be enabled on any personal or business account. And those privacy settings will impact hashtag post visibility.</p><p> When the settings do not let anyone else but your followers see your posts, even posts with a hashtag are not visible to non-followers. It will be important to adjust those settings to ensure that you have a wider reach with your posts that include hashtags.</p><p> For instance, you could choose a privacy setting where only <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/help/134343280099148?helpref=uf_permalink" >followers can see the posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or followers along with friends of followers. The second option gives you a little more reach, but still limits visibility.</p><p> When marketers are attempting to reach the widest possible audience, making posts public is the way to go. It will make non-hashtag posts public as well. But it ensures that any post with a hashtag has incredible reach.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Hashtags have become a crucial element of the Facebook experience. Someone who is searching for a product or service in the area, reading about a popular topic, or hoping to gather information on a news story will use hashtags. Marketers can use hashtags to ensure that any promotional campaigns, influencer marketing strategies or general posts are reaching a wider audience.</p><p> So hashtags are so important to Facebook.

Don’t Spam Even if Your Post is Legit"></a>1. Don’t Spam Even if Your Post is Legit</h4><p>It is important to understand that no site likes spamming. The same behavior is adopted by Facebook as the sheriff is always out to ensure that the site is safe for all. Even if your post is legit try to increase the time interval between posts.</p><p>If you post the same content over several groups or pages then you can land into issues. Facebook will block your account for future use. You might also end up being terminated permanently just in case the message was widely spread.</p><h4 id="2-Plagiarism-is-Your-Enemy"><a href="#2-Plagiarism-is-Your-Enemy" class="headerlink" title="2. Plagiarism is Your Enemy"></a>2. Plagiarism is Your Enemy</h4><p>It is a fact that plagiarism is your enemy. If you just post the link to the content and don’t spam it, it is just fine. If you are copying the entire content you will land into issues.</p><p>The same applies to the images that have been used in your posts. Certain images are on Google Images and have been marked as spam. Using such images will result in penalization and ultimate Facebook jail which will hamper your productivity.</p><p>It is advice from the content creators that work for Facebook that always use original content to avoid misadventure.</p><p>Here, I recommend Wondershare Filmora to create original yet interesting videos on Facebook effortlessly. With Filmora Template Mode, it is easier than ever to edit your Facebook videos because the AI-powered tool will edit the videos automatically.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="3-Avoid-Being-Anon-and-Tag-Carefully"><a href="#3-Avoid-Being-Anon-and-Tag-Carefully" class="headerlink" title="3. Avoid Being Anon and Tag Carefully"></a>3. Avoid Being Anon and Tag Carefully</h4><p>Don’t be anonymous with your friends as it can result in issues. If you are being anonymous for no reason and to top it all tagging your “Friends” then you can land in trouble. Real people are the best ones you should always use your real friend to tag into a post.</p><p>Honesty is the best policy and Facebook likes it as well. Tagging random people can get your account blocked permanently. It is one of the best ways on the topic of how to get out of Facebook jail with ease.</p><p>Add people to your group if you know them and only tag them with your real and personal profile. The element of trust is very important and will benefit you a lot in the long run.</p><h4 id="4-Use-the-Site-properly"><a href="#4-Use-the-Site-properly" class="headerlink" title="4. Use the Site properly"></a>4. Use the Site properly</h4><p>How do you know if you are in Facebook jail? The simple answer to this is the fact that you are not using the site properly. Get to know how the website works and how can you benefit from the features of the site.</p><p>Too much knowledge is dangerous and the same happens with the people as they start manipulating the algorithm of the site. Always remember that the people that are sitting in the management of Facebook are smarter than you are. You will not only get banned but if the offense is done repetitively then you might be kicked out permanently.</p><h4 id="5-One-Facebook-Account-for-One-Person"><a href="#5-One-Facebook-Account-for-One-Person" class="headerlink" title="5. One Facebook Account for One Person"></a>5. One Facebook Account for One Person</h4><p>It is important to note that for life you can have only one Facebook account. The algorithm has been defined in such a way that the links between the accounts are also explored by the bots. If Facebook gets to know the link between two of your accounts then you are done.</p><p>Some people get a ban as they create a profile for personal use and the business profile is also used for the same purpose. If this happens the Facebook will block you from posting from any of your accounts. In all such cases, the content is blocked and the person is Facebook jailed.</p><h4 id="6-Don’t-Act-Weird"><a href="#6-Don’t-Act-Weird" class="headerlink" title="6. Don’t Act Weird"></a>6. Don’t Act Weird</h4><p>Believe it or not but this can also lead to your account suspension. For instance, if you are sending friend requests to people you don’t know then it is obvious that you will get jail for it i.e. the one on Facebook. Don’t send multiple requests at the same time as it can also make the site feel that you are a spammer.</p><p>The other issue is that people use private messaging to promote their business. It should never be done as it can lead to issues and troubles. Even don’t ever advertise your business on the pages of other businesses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/out-of-facebook-jail.jpg"                      alt="facebook jail"                ></p><h4 id="7-Beware-of-Dirty-Play"><a href="#7-Beware-of-Dirty-Play" class="headerlink" title="7. Beware of Dirty Play"></a>7. Beware of Dirty Play</h4><p>Beware of the people that can get your page marked as spam. This is done on a large scale just to harm your reputation. The first thing that you would notice is a constant spamming of your posts in the form of trolls.</p><p>In case any such behavior is observed then such accounts must be banned from your page. Also, report the individual accounts by marking them as spam. Perform this action ASAP so that you remain out of trouble.</p><p>Last but not least; reach out to customer support. Once they get to know this you are in the safe zone. Many links can be used to get the information as profiles and the pages get attacked all day every day.</p><h4 id="8-Comment-and-Like-but-be-Cautious"><a href="#8-Comment-and-Like-but-be-Cautious" class="headerlink" title="8. Comment and Like but be Cautious"></a>8. Comment and Like but be Cautious</h4><p>It is another important factor that should be considered to avoid Facebook Timeout. Liking and commenting on pages at a fast pace is the main reason. If this is the case the Facebook algorithm will consider you like a spam bot.</p><p>Such bots are developed to mimic human behavior. You just need to control your pace and don’t have to be too quick as it can get you into the Facebook jail for no reason. Traffic information is an asset to Facebook and this is done just to maintain the balance.</p><h4 id="9-Avoid-Information-Overload"><a href="#9-Avoid-Information-Overload" class="headerlink" title="9. Avoid Information Overload"></a>9. Avoid Information Overload</h4><p>The information that you share on your profile or page must be very much balanced. It is a simple phenomenon and the business models should be developed in the same manner. Sharing every bit of detail is neither recommended nor does Facebook like it.</p><p>If you are running a business page then it is important that you only post 5 – 6 times a day. Telling customers everything on Facebook is not likable and at times the customers also get frustrated by getting constant notifications. Such users won’t hesitate to mark your page as spam and get you into trouble.</p><h4 id="10-Be-as-Accessible-as-Possible"><a href="#10-Be-as-Accessible-as-Possible" class="headerlink" title="10. Be as Accessible as Possible"></a>10. Be as Accessible as Possible</h4><p>Your consumers must contact you easily. Providing adequate info on your page is the only way to do so. It is something that Facebook likes and the info presented should be permanent.</p><p>Permanent info shows that you are here to stay and are the owner of a legit business. The information section of your page should reflect instantly who you are and what the page is about. This will also help you in generating leads and get more new users regularly.</p><h2 id="How-to-Find-Out-If-You-Are-in-Facebook-Jail"><a href="#How-to-Find-Out-If-You-Are-in-Facebook-Jail" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Out If You Are in Facebook Jail?"></a>How to Find Out If You Are in Facebook Jail?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-jail-2.jpg"                      alt="what is facebook jail"                ></p><p>It is too simple and there is no need for any sort of software or installation for this. If you have screwed something up as soon as you log in you will get to know. If you are in a current Facebook session and get jailed you will not be able to like the next post you see.</p><p>As compared to the past the Facebook policies have become stern with time. Getting jailed means that you have violated the terms and conditions of the website usage. In such a situation, you just need to read through this guide.</p><p>Facebook jail is easy to break but only if you employ the right strategy. Take a look at your profile to know the reason and the pages you manage. If everything fails then it is advised to turn to the Facebook community for help and contact their support to find a way out.</p><h2 id="Why-Are-You-in-Facebook-Jail"><a href="#Why-Are-You-in-Facebook-Jail" class="headerlink" title="Why Are You in Facebook Jail?"></a>Why Are You in Facebook Jail?</h2><p>There are several reasons for which you have been Facebook jailed. Some most important reasons are mentioned as under:</p><ul><li>If you have been posting nude and provocative content then you will get banned. Facebook has a very stern policy against such content.</li><li>If you hate a group then keep it to yourself. There must not be any hate speech, threats, or attacks on any person or group on Facebook.</li><li>Spamming is like getting your Facebook account closed with your hand. Don’t do it or else you will regret it.</li><li>Never think that you have a large fan following and you can manipulate the Facebook algorithm. Regardless of the fan base, you will get banned instantly.</li><li>Real you are liked by Facebook. Imposter you are spam and therefore will ultimately get blocked for posting a fake update and plagiarized content.</li><li>There can be any term or condition that has been violated by the subscriber that can lead to the issue.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-jail-3.jpg"                      alt="what is facebook jail"                ></p><p>Also, you must take care of the following points so that you never get into trouble or in Facebook Time out Mode:</p><p><strong>Read the Terms of Service</strong></p><p>It is important to read the <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php" >terms of service of Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Before you start a page on Facebook just read through the Facebook terms of service so that you never get into trouble. Reading and understanding are important instead of thinking that getting out of Facebook jail-free card will do the trick.</p><p><strong>Suspicious Payments</strong></p><p>Register your real credit card for Facebook ads. It should be yours and must be in your possession all the time. Facebook does not like fraud and doing it with the site will get you banned instantly. Also, any payments that have been made through such cards will be reversed and you will face the penalty.</p><p>No site likes stolen cards to be registered with them and Facebook has all the right to put you in jail if this happens.</p><h2 id="How-Long-Facebook-Jail-Does-Last"><a href="#How-Long-Facebook-Jail-Does-Last" class="headerlink" title="How Long Facebook Jail Does Last?"></a>How Long Facebook Jail Does Last?</h2><p>It is never advised to breach the rules of the website. It is something that is unacceptable and you will get into trouble sooner rather than later. Don’t ever go for the like services no manner how much they have spoken highly of their services.</p><p>Getting fake likes is one of the things that could get you into trouble.</p><p>First thing first your account cannot get blocked for more than 21 days. If you are still unable to post after the said period then you have been executed. The Facebook block can be classified into 3 categories:</p><ul><li><strong>The Highest Level</strong></li></ul><p>It is the complete suspension of the account. It means that you are gone and done. There is no way to get the account back and the content as well.</p><p>In such a case, if anyone visits your page he will either be redirected to the main page or there would be a 404 error.</p><ul><li><strong>The Middle Level</strong></li></ul><p>In such a case, certain features of your account are permanently suspended. Your account is not blocked but the features are forever disabled. For instance, you can post content to your timeline but cannot like the content on a friend’s timeline.</p><p>There are other features that are also suspended in such cases. It includes Facebook ads, the marketplace, and group access. Depending upon the circumstances you might also not be able to access Facebook-based subscriptions as well.</p><ul><li><strong>The Lowest Level</strong></li></ul><p>This level expires once the timeline mentioned by Facebook passes. The same features will be disabled which is done in the middle level but the ban is temporary. There is also a feature that allows you to file an appeal and this ban could get lifted even before the maturity date.</p><h2 id="How-to-Come-out-of-Facebook-Jail-if-You-Get-Blocked"><a href="#How-to-Come-out-of-Facebook-Jail-if-You-Get-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="How to Come out of Facebook Jail if You Get Blocked?"></a>How to Come out of Facebook Jail if You Get Blocked?</h2><p>When it comes to the lowest level there is pretty much what can be done. You can file an appeal for a Facebook review. Once it is done you will get an email about the outcome of your appeal.</p><p>Either the website will accept or reject it. There have been many cases where people have won the appeals and the site has restored their functionality.</p><p>As for the other two levels which are higher there is nothing that you could do. The simple thing is to not waste your energy and get going with a new page or even an account. In a nutshell, you can get out of the lowest level of penalty but for the other two levels, the chances are slim to none.</p><p>Getting out of the Facebook jail is not a play and therefore should not be taken easily. The best part is that there is a bit of control which you can enjoy when it comes to this subject. It means that on the lowest level you can enjoy limited control in the form of appeal.</p><p><strong>Facebook Jail Meme</strong></p><p>Facebook jail meme can be regarded as a type of protest against the block by the website. Though these are just memes there are pages on Facebook those post such pictures. These pages just make it a fun-filled activity and the memes can also be downloaded and saved for future use.</p><p>Other than the Facebook pages many websites offer such content. You can download the images and post them to your Facebook account. This is a light fun-filled activity and you will enjoy it a lot.</p><p>Below are some websites that can be used to download such memes:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://ballmemes.com/t/facebook-jail-meme" >ballmemes.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://memeshappen.com/" >memeshappen.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://isitfunnyoroffensive.com/" >isitfunnyoroffensive.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>And here are the websites that you can generate your own funny Facebook jail memes:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/25149768/Facebook-jail" >imgflip.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.memecreator.org/template/levi-fb-jail" >memecreator.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Facebook jail is something you never want to get into. The only way out of this is to avoid it. Prevention is better than cure and just refraining from the activities Facebook doesn’t like is the only way to elude the problem completely.</p><p>This problem is only faced if you are not abiding by the terms and conditions of the website. If you are planning on using Facebook for your business then it is advised to go through the terms and conditions. It will help you to come out of trouble easily and effectively without much effort and energy.</p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://wordhtml.com/" >online Word 2 HTML converter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lets you transform Word documents into clean code with just a few clicks.</p><p> <strong>Make Your Own Original Content to Avoid Being Blocked in Facebook Jail.</strong></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-exclusive-guide-to-the-best-20-incarceration-moments-that-spark-smiles-online/"><u>In 2024, Exclusive Guide to the Best 20 Incarceration Moments that Spark Smiles Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-expert-video-grabbing-kit-perfect-for-firefox-browser-users-for-2024/"><u>[New] Expert Video Grabbing Kit  Perfect for FireFox Browser Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-dive-deep-into-facebooks-in-stream-ad-strategies-setup-and-analysis-insights-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Dive Deep Into Facebook's In-Stream Ad Strategies  Setup and Analysis Insights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unveiling-the-top-5-facebook-video-downloaders-today/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unveiling the Top 5 Facebook Video Downloaders Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-televising-digital-media-integrating-fb-video-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] Televising Digital Media  Integrating FB Video , In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-virtual-accessory-fb-story-saves/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Virtual Accessory -

There are a few things to keep in mind when creating your image:</p><ul><li>Use high-quality images that are eye-catching and relevant to your product or service.</li><li>Make sure your text is easy to read, and avoid overcrowding your image with too much information.</li><li>Make sure your branding is consistent across all of your marketing materials.</li><li>Keep your target audience in mind when creating your image.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-make-a-creative-image-for-Facebook-Ads"><a href="#Why-make-a-creative-image-for-Facebook-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why make a creative image for Facebook Ads"></a>Why make a creative image for Facebook Ads</h2><p>There are a few reasons why you need to make a creative image before running a Facebook an Ad:</p><p>First, an eye-catching image will help to grab the reader’s attention and make them more likely to read your ad.</p><p>Second, including relevant images with your ad will help to illustrate your product or service and make it easier for your audience to understand what you’re selling.</p><p>And finally, having consistent branding across all of your marketing materials will help to create a professional image for your business.</p><h2 id="Difference-between-Facebook-Ads-and-Facebook-Post"><a href="#Difference-between-Facebook-Ads-and-Facebook-Post" class="headerlink" title="Difference between Facebook Ads and Facebook Post"></a>Difference between Facebook Ads and Facebook Post</h2><p>A Facebook post is simply a message that you post on your Facebook page. A Facebook ad is a message that you pay to have displayed on other people’s Facebook pages. There are a few key differences between Facebook posts and ads:</p><ul><li>Facebook posts are free to create, while Facebook ads require a payment.</li><li>Facebook posts are only visible to people who have liked your page, while Facebook ads can be targeted to specific audiences.</li><li>Facebook ads can include more information than posts, including clickable links and images.</li><li>Facebook ads will always be shown in the News Feed, while Facebook posts may not be seen by all of your followers.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/facebook-feeds.jpg"                      alt="facebook feeds"                ></p><p>Now that you know the difference between a Facebook post and an ad, let’s take a look at how to create an effective ad.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-effective-facebook-ads.jpg"                      alt="create effective facebook ads"                ></p><h2 id="The-Three-Simple-Copywriting-Structures"><a href="#The-Three-Simple-Copywriting-Structures" class="headerlink" title="The Three Simple Copywriting Structures"></a>The Three Simple Copywriting Structures</h2><p><strong>#1. Connect to the Pain of your Target Audience</strong></p><p>The first step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to connect with the pain of your target audience. What problem are they trying to solve? What need do they have that your product or service can fill?</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to speak to the pain of being overweight or feeling self-conscious about one’s appearance.</p><p><strong>#2. Introduce the Solution</strong></p><p>Once you’ve connected with the pain of your target audience, you can introduce the solution that your product or service provides. This is where you talk about what your product or service can do for them.</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to talk about how your product can help them to lose weight and feel more confident.</p><p><strong>#3. Call to Action</strong></p><p>The last step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to include a call to action. This is where you tell the reader what you want them to do next. Do you want them to click on your ad, visit your website, or purchase your product? Make sure your call to action is clear and concise.</p><p>For example, if you want the reader to click on your ad, you might say something like “Click here to learn more about our weight loss product.”</p><p><strong>Example of Facebook ads Creative Image</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/creative-facebook-ads-example.jpg"                      alt="creative facebook ads example"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three simple structures for creating a creative image for your Facebook Ads, it’s time to get started!

However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571" >the announcemetn of Mark Zuckerberg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Facebook algorithm will focus on meaningful interactions, resulted in marketers more worrying about their ability to reach a targeted audience in 2024.</p><p>There is also concern about how the <a class="link"   href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/" >Facebook algorithm change <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would impact the ability of businesses to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >work with influencers on the platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The changes are geared towards showing people more content from friends and family, instead of business posts, so the changes in 2024 are so much different than previous changes.</p><p>In this case, it is much more important to know the Facebook algorithm change for marketers in 2024. How can marketers work around these changes?

The basic meaning is that Facebook cares more about user spending quality on Facebook, rather than just focus on time. Traditionally, time spent is a key factor to measure Facebook’s growth, which results in increasing users’ spending time with all efforts. Now, things are changed. Facebook algorithm decides sharing and commenting are the symbols of meaningful interactions, meaning that Facebook wants you interact with friends. Randomly click likes on a photo, article or video are no longer positive signal to algorithm.</p><p>There <a class="link"   href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/new-facebook-algorithm-26-friends/" >once comes a rumor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Facebook will only show 26 friends in feed, which is false. In fact, Facebook algorithm is broken down into four components. There is <strong>inventory</strong>, <strong>signals</strong>, <strong>predictions</strong> and the <strong>overall score</strong>. Signals are the considerations about content. And it is signals that marketers and businesses must focus on when they are promoting content through the Facebook news feed.</p><p>Signals include the average time spent on content, when it’s posted, the type of story, how many comments or likes it gets, and how often it is shared on the news feed or through Messenger.</p><p>The idea is that Facebook will promote content that gets more engagement, because those are the posts likely to come from family and friends. It is up to marketers to ensure their content is similarly personal and conversation-worthy!</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: if you want to get a higher ranking in Facebook feed, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating square videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an important method.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors"><a href="#Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors"></a>Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors</h2><p>When it comes to how content is ordered and presented on the Facebook news feed, there are four factors that go into the process. These ranking factors include comments, sharing, reactions and engagement. We explore each factor in depth below:</p><h3 id="1-Comments"><a href="#1-Comments" class="headerlink" title="1. Comments"></a>1. Comments</h3><p>When people or businesses make posts that no one reacts to - those posts are going to be shown a lot less in a person’s feed. Pages that promote conversation and get a lot of engagement will see a significant rise.</p><p>Brands must work on content that is getting people to comment and then converse with each other through the comment chain. It can be a focus on timely and relevant topics, which will get people talking immediately!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-comment.JPG"                      alt="facebook algorithm change comment 2019"                ></p><h3 id="2-Sharing"><a href="#2-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="2. Sharing"></a>2. Sharing</h3><p>Did you know that when <a class="link"   href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/facebook-messenger-link-urls-security/" >a link is shared on Messenger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Facebook users, it has an impact on how that post appears on the feed? Facebook cares about the interactions that people have through the content posted on the site. And that means a focus on content that is shared through Messenger.</p><p>Say a company makes a post that many followers enjoy. They like and&#x2F;or comment on the post. But they also copy the link and share it with friends through Messenger, instead of sharing it publicly on their feed.</p><p>Such shares are just as important as the public sharing. Many companies would focus on the public aspect with previous content. But now they can focus on getting people to share articles through the private chats on Messenger.</p><h3 id="3-Reactions"><a href="#3-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="3. Reactions"></a>3. Reactions</h3><p>People having a reaction to your content is increasingly important. When someone reacts to the comment through the available emojis, the post will be higher up in many followers’ feeds.</p><p>What also matters is the type of reaction they are having. It is said that when someone clicks on the love icon, it has a slightly better impact through the algorithm as compared to the like icon.</p><p>Facebook wants to see people having active and unique reactions to the post. Even the Wow, Sad, Angry and Haha icons have a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/resources/facebook-reactions" >more positive result as compared to the simple likes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-algorithm-change-reaction.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change Reactions"                ></p><h3 id="4-Engagement"><a href="#4-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="4. Engagement"></a>4. Engagement</h3><p>Facebook is going one step further when it comes to the engagement triggers on the algorithm. In the past, having the post shared by different users was enough to see it get a positive bump in the algorithm.</p><p>While those shares are still helpful, the impact is a bit less. What is really needed is a reaction on the shares of your followers.</p><p>Say your company makes a post and it is shared by 50 people. If there are many reactions to the followers of those 50 people when they shared your post, the original post will see a significant bump through the algorithm.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers"><a href="#Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers"></a>Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers</h2><p>The Facebook algorithm changes mean that it will be more challenging to reach people with posts that are made by businesses.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together" >Companies will need a very engaged audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if they want to gain traction on the feed through organic means. And that means posts that are shared, commented on, reacted to and more popular with the Facebook audience. Some pages will start posting something irrelevant with their business. But it is always important to build powerful content like Facebook says.</p><h2 id="Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm"><a href="#Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm"></a>Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm</h2><h3 id="1-Pay-attention-to-video"><a href="#1-Pay-attention-to-video" class="headerlink" title="1. Pay attention to video"></a>1. Pay attention to video</h3><p>Videos tend to attract engagement naturally if the video is good enough. However, have you ever considered live video? Facebook official said live video gets 6 times interactions than regular videos. It is true. In this Facebook algorithm change, <a class="link"   href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-live-why-live-video-matters-for-marketers/" >live video matters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. More and more business owners try the new field - live video and they did pretty good. If you haven’t invest live video, now you should start looking for this new method to boost comments and shares.</p><p>Just like Facebook did in May 2. It showed Mark’s opening keynote on Facebook’s latest technology and innovation. Now, this live video has gained more than 1 thousand comments and shares. If you want to make Facebook videos, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It includes various titles&#x2F;text templates, visual effects and audio to make your marketing video perfect.</p><h3 id="2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities"><a href="#2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Engagement Opportunities"></a>2. Create Engagement Opportunities</h3><p>When people have more conversations on your posts, it means those posts are going to be higher up on the feed. Facebook cares about the interactions people are having with content, as they want them to spend more time on the platform.</p><p>Companies often use Facebook to put out basic news stories about the company, new products or discounts. While these posts are interesting, they are not exactly conversation starters. It will be up to businesses to ensure they are creating content that can help people have more meaningful conversations on the platform.</p><p>Sharing news stories that are related to the industry is one way to do this. A company does not always have to promote its own business through Facebook posts. Sharing opinions on changes in an industry that your followers care about is a good way to boost engagement levels, so making engagement opportunities is a great method to rely to Facebook algorithm change.</p><h3 id="3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups"><a href="#3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups" class="headerlink" title="3. Leverage Facebook Groups"></a>3. Leverage Facebook Groups</h3><p>Did you know that around <a class="link"   href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/27/facebook-groups-reaches-1-billion-users/79414710/" >1 billion people use Facebook Groups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? And around 100 million people say that when they are on Facebook, they are primarily using Groups to interact with other people and content.</p><p>Groups are the perfect way to build a community that is active and interested in specific topics. If a business can create groups that are targeting a community, niche or a segment of the market, it will help them boost engagement levels. Posts that are shared within those groups will see a lot of engagement, as they are filled with users who care about the content.</p><p>The impact will not only be felt in rising engagement within those groups, but in the way those posts are ranked in the general feed as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/facebook-groups.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change 2019"                ></p><h3 id="4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads"><a href="#4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads" class="headerlink" title="4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads"></a>4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads</h3><p>The changes that Facebook has made to its algorithm were done with the company’s future in mind. Facebook wants to make more money and fuel growth. They do not want a user base that is rarely checking the platform or interacting with content.</p><p>The best advice that we can give to marketers and business owners is to ignore Facebook ads. The company has made changes so that you will turn to ads and simply pay to get your posts to the top of the feed.</p><p>But that does not have to be the case. You can completely ignore ads and focus on the organic efforts that we have mentioned above. Those will get you the higher levels of engagement that you need to remain relevant with the new algorithm. But you can still <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make ads by Facebook video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/facebook-ads.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change 2019"                ></p><h3 id="5-Stick-to-strong-content"><a href="#5-Stick-to-strong-content" class="headerlink" title="5. Stick to strong content"></a>5. Stick to strong content</h3><p>It is understandable for companies to feel as though a scary change has taken place on Facebook. The way that posts are prioritized in the feed is different to what it was before. Facebook claims it is all about getting family and friend posts closer to the top of the feed.</p><p>But like any algorithm change, marketers can react to ensure the content they are promoting is being seen by as many people as possible. <a class="link"   href="https://www.naturettl.com/upload-photos-facebook-best-quality-possible/" >Improving engagement and promoting conversation-worthy content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can help make that happen.</p><h3 id="6-Try-Facebook-influencer"><a href="#6-Try-Facebook-influencer" class="headerlink" title="6. Try Facebook influencer"></a>6. Try Facebook influencer</h3><p>Have you experienced posting a image without any engagement, even likes? If it happens, you should change your posting strategy. Today, Facebook influencer is showing powerful influencing ability. You should look for an influencer who has the same audience you want and are willing to interact with your brand. However, you should be aware of some influencers might have fake fans to get likes. As in this new Facebook algorithm change, likes are not the most essential factor, so you need to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >distinguish the fake fans and real fans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/algorithm-change-on-facebook-influencer.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change influencer"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this guide will help any business or marketer that is looking to use Facebook for promotional purposes in 2024.

However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571" >the announcemetn of Mark Zuckerberg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Facebook algorithm will focus on meaningful interactions, resulted in marketers more worrying about their ability to reach a targeted audience in 2024.</p><p>There is also concern about how the <a class="link"   href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/" >Facebook algorithm change <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would impact the ability of businesses to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >work with influencers on the platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The changes are geared towards showing people more content from friends and family, instead of business posts, so the changes in 2024 are so much different than previous changes.</p><p>In this case, it is much more important to know the Facebook algorithm change for marketers in 2024. How can marketers work around these changes?

The basic meaning is that Facebook cares more about user spending quality on Facebook, rather than just focus on time. Traditionally, time spent is a key factor to measure Facebook’s growth, which results in increasing users’ spending time with all efforts. Now, things are changed. Facebook algorithm decides sharing and commenting are the symbols of meaningful interactions, meaning that Facebook wants you interact with friends. Randomly click likes on a photo, article or video are no longer positive signal to algorithm.</p><p>There <a class="link"   href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/new-facebook-algorithm-26-friends/" >once comes a rumor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Facebook will only show 26 friends in feed, which is false. In fact, Facebook algorithm is broken down into four components. There is <strong>inventory</strong>, <strong>signals</strong>, <strong>predictions</strong> and the <strong>overall score</strong>. Signals are the considerations about content. And it is signals that marketers and businesses must focus on when they are promoting content through the Facebook news feed.</p><p>Signals include the average time spent on content, when it’s posted, the type of story, how many comments or likes it gets, and how often it is shared on the news feed or through Messenger.</p><p>The idea is that Facebook will promote content that gets more engagement, because those are the posts likely to come from family and friends. It is up to marketers to ensure their content is similarly personal and conversation-worthy!</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: if you want to get a higher ranking in Facebook feed, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating square videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an important method.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors"><a href="#Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors"></a>Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors</h2><p>When it comes to how content is ordered and presented on the Facebook news feed, there are four factors that go into the process. These ranking factors include comments, sharing, reactions and engagement. We explore each factor in depth below:</p><h3 id="1-Comments"><a href="#1-Comments" class="headerlink" title="1. Comments"></a>1. Comments</h3><p>When people or businesses make posts that no one reacts to - those posts are going to be shown a lot less in a person’s feed. Pages that promote conversation and get a lot of engagement will see a significant rise.</p><p>Brands must work on content that is getting people to comment and then converse with each other through the comment chain. It can be a focus on timely and relevant topics, which will get people talking immediately!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-comment.JPG"                      alt="facebook algorithm change comment 2019"                ></p><h3 id="2-Sharing"><a href="#2-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="2. Sharing"></a>2. Sharing</h3><p>Did you know that when <a class="link"   href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/facebook-messenger-link-urls-security/" >a link is shared on Messenger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Facebook users, it has an impact on how that post appears on the feed? Facebook cares about the interactions that people have through the content posted on the site. And that means a focus on content that is shared through Messenger.</p><p>Say a company makes a post that many followers enjoy. They like and&#x2F;or comment on the post. But they also copy the link and share it with friends through Messenger, instead of sharing it publicly on their feed.</p><p>Such shares are just as important as the public sharing. Many companies would focus on the public aspect with previous content. But now they can focus on getting people to share articles through the private chats on Messenger.</p><h3 id="3-Reactions"><a href="#3-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="3. Reactions"></a>3. Reactions</h3><p>People having a reaction to your content is increasingly important. When someone reacts to the comment through the available emojis, the post will be higher up in many followers’ feeds.</p><p>What also matters is the type of reaction they are having. It is said that when someone clicks on the love icon, it has a slightly better impact through the algorithm as compared to the like icon.</p><p>Facebook wants to see people having active and unique reactions to the post. Even the Wow, Sad, Angry and Haha icons have a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/resources/facebook-reactions" >more positive result as compared to the simple likes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-algorithm-change-reaction.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change Reactions"                ></p><h3 id="4-Engagement"><a href="#4-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="4. Engagement"></a>4. Engagement</h3><p>Facebook is going one step further when it comes to the engagement triggers on the algorithm. In the past, having the post shared by different users was enough to see it get a positive bump in the algorithm.</p><p>While those shares are still helpful, the impact is a bit less. What is really needed is a reaction on the shares of your followers.</p><p>Say your company makes a post and it is shared by 50 people. If there are many reactions to the followers of those 50 people when they shared your post, the original post will see a significant bump through the algorithm.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers"><a href="#Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers"></a>Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers</h2><p>The Facebook algorithm changes mean that it will be more challenging to reach people with posts that are made by businesses.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together" >Companies will need a very engaged audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if they want to gain traction on the feed through organic means. And that means posts that are shared, commented on, reacted to and more popular with the Facebook audience. Some pages will start posting something irrelevant with their business. But it is always important to build powerful content like Facebook says.</p><h2 id="Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm"><a href="#Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm"></a>Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm</h2><h3 id="1-Pay-attention-to-video"><a href="#1-Pay-attention-to-video" class="headerlink" title="1. Pay attention to video"></a>1. Pay attention to video</h3><p>Videos tend to attract engagement naturally if the video is good enough. However, have you ever considered live video? Facebook official said live video gets 6 times interactions than regular videos. It is true. In this Facebook algorithm change, <a class="link"   href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-live-why-live-video-matters-for-marketers/" >live video matters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. More and more business owners try the new field - live video and they did pretty good. If you haven’t invest live video, now you should start looking for this new method to boost comments and shares.</p><p>Just like Facebook did in May 2. It showed Mark’s opening keynote on Facebook’s latest technology and innovation. Now, this live video has gained more than 1 thousand comments and shares. If you want to make Facebook videos, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It includes various titles&#x2F;text templates, visual effects and audio to make your marketing video perfect.</p><h3 id="2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities"><a href="#2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Engagement Opportunities"></a>2. Create Engagement Opportunities</h3><p>When people have more conversations on your posts, it means those posts are going to be higher up on the feed. Facebook cares about the interactions people are having with content, as they want them to spend more time on the platform.</p><p>Companies often use Facebook to put out basic news stories about the company, new products or discounts. While these posts are interesting, they are not exactly conversation starters. It will be up to businesses to ensure they are creating content that can help people have more meaningful conversations on the platform.</p><p>Sharing news stories that are related to the industry is one way to do this. A company does not always have to promote its own business through Facebook posts. Sharing opinions on changes in an industry that your followers care about is a good way to boost engagement levels, so making engagement opportunities is a great method to rely to Facebook algorithm change.</p><h3 id="3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups"><a href="#3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups" class="headerlink" title="3. Leverage Facebook Groups"></a>3. Leverage Facebook Groups</h3><p>Did you know that around <a class="link"   href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/27/facebook-groups-reaches-1-billion-users/79414710/" >1 billion people use Facebook Groups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? And around 100 million people say that when they are on Facebook, they are primarily using Groups to interact with other people and content.</p><p>Groups are the perfect way to build a community that is active and interested in specific topics. If a business can create groups that are targeting a community, niche or a segment of the market, it will help them boost engagement levels. Posts that are shared within those groups will see a lot of engagement, as they are filled with users who care about the content.</p><p>The impact will not only be felt in rising engagement within those groups, but in the way those posts are ranked in the general feed as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/facebook-groups.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change 2019"                ></p><h3 id="4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads"><a href="#4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads" class="headerlink" title="4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads"></a>4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads</h3><p>The changes that Facebook has made to its algorithm were done with the company’s future in mind. Facebook wants to make more money and fuel growth. They do not want a user base that is rarely checking the platform or interacting with content.</p><p>The best advice that we can give to marketers and business owners is to ignore Facebook ads. The company has made changes so that you will turn to ads and simply pay to get your posts to the top of the feed.</p><p>But that does not have to be the case. You can completely ignore ads and focus on the organic efforts that we have mentioned above. Those will get you the higher levels of engagement that you need to remain relevant with the new algorithm. But you can still <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make ads by Facebook video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/facebook-ads.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change 2019"                ></p><h3 id="5-Stick-to-strong-content"><a href="#5-Stick-to-strong-content" class="headerlink" title="5. Stick to strong content"></a>5. Stick to strong content</h3><p>It is understandable for companies to feel as though a scary change has taken place on Facebook. The way that posts are prioritized in the feed is different to what it was before. Facebook claims it is all about getting family and friend posts closer to the top of the feed.</p><p>But like any algorithm change, marketers can react to ensure the content they are promoting is being seen by as many people as possible. <a class="link"   href="https://www.naturettl.com/upload-photos-facebook-best-quality-possible/" >Improving engagement and promoting conversation-worthy content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can help make that happen.</p><h3 id="6-Try-Facebook-influencer"><a href="#6-Try-Facebook-influencer" class="headerlink" title="6. Try Facebook influencer"></a>6. Try Facebook influencer</h3><p>Have you experienced posting a image without any engagement, even likes? If it happens, you should change your posting strategy. Today, Facebook influencer is showing powerful influencing ability. You should look for an influencer who has the same audience you want and are willing to interact with your brand. However, you should be aware of some influencers might have fake fans to get likes. As in this new Facebook algorithm change, likes are not the most essential factor, so you need to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >distinguish the fake fans and real fans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/algorithm-change-on-facebook-influencer.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change influencer"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this guide will help any business or marketer that is looking to use Facebook for promotional purposes in 2024.

Wondering how to make your videos better for your News Feed? Worry not, my friend! We have all the answers!</p><p>Just as we are mindful of the orientation of our pictures, similarly, we should focus on the orientation of our videos as well.</p><p>If you want to take a close-up of someone, you should use the portrait orientation; however, landscape orientation should be your go-to if you want a zoomed-out look. However, in the age of social media, you need to be mindful of where you will post the content.</p><p>This is because different social media platforms support different orientations, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-1.jpg"                      alt="Different Video Aspect Ratios on Mobile Devices"                ></p><p>So, for your Facebook videos, the ideal aspect ratio is 2:3. However, let’s take a closer look and see what works best for you; horizontal video or vertical Facebook video?</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">Bonus Tip!

Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

For this you need to go to Google Play or App Store and download the Speedtest application.</p><p> 4.
