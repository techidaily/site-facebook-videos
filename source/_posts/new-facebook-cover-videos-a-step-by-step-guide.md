* **Make it unique, but Professional:** Social media is a place to go crazy, and fun but never go off-brand or too stupid.

* **Make it magical or animated:** Animated videos are the best magicians to provoke a magical touch. With just still images, they bring a new world alive before our eyes.
* **Showcase your product personality:** Video being dynamic than photos, **FB cover videos** are the best place to showcase your brand products and services.
