* Facebook posts are free to create, while Facebook ads require a payment.
* Facebook posts are only visible to people who have liked your page, while Facebook ads can be targeted to specific audiences.

## The Three Simple Copywriting Structures

**#1\. Connect to the Pain of your Target Audience**

The first step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to connect with the pain of your target audience. What problem are they trying to solve? What need do they have that your product or service can fill?

For example, if you're selling a weight loss product, you might want to speak to the pain of being overweight or feeling self-conscious about one's appearance.

**#2\. Introduce the Solution**

Once you've connected with the pain of your target audience, you can introduce the solution that your product or service provides. This is where you talk about what your product or service can do for them.

For example, if you're selling a weight loss product, you might want to talk about how your product can help them to lose weight and feel more confident.

**#3\. Call to Action**

The last step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to include a call to action. This is where you tell the reader what you want them to do next. Do you want them to click on your ad, visit your website, or purchase your product? Make sure your call to action is clear and concise.

For example, if you want the reader to click on your ad, you might say something like "Click here to learn more about our weight loss product."
