## Part 4: How to Make My Posted Videos Show up on Chrome?

It is important to pay attention to **why can't I see my uploaded videos on Facebook** via Chrome? The article presents four effortless methods to help with **FB videos not showing up.**

### Solution 1: Altering the Video Format

Facebook supports MP4 and MOV formats for your videos. Therefore, it is recommended to convert your video format to MP4 or MOV. Wondershare UniConverter offers great help for this process. Follow the guidelines below to start the video conversion process.

**Step 1:** Launch Wondershare UniConverter from your system and click on "Converter" from the left panel. Add the targeted video file by clicking on "Add Files."

**Step 2:** Import the Facebook video. When the video is displayed on the interface, use the "Output Format" located in the bottom left corner to set it to MP4 or MOV.

![choose the required format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/posted-facebook-videos-not-showing-up-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click on "Convert" button. Wait a couple of seconds until the process is completed.

### Solution 2: Clear Browsing Data

**Step 1:** Open the browser and click on three dots from the top left corner of the interface. Click on "Settings" from there. Navigate to "Privacy and Security" afterward.

**Step 2:** Tap on "Clear Browsing Data" and set the time range. You can choose to clear the data from all times, since a week or an hour before. Tick mark on all options to get rid of cache.
