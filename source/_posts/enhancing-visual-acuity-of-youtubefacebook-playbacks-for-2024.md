Even if you play a video of 1080p resolution, Facebook controls the display settings. It is because the high-quality videos take longer to load. The display settings are tailored to low quality to be played without facing the buffering issue. It makes the video blurry.

### Video Compression

The ideal Facebook video size is 720p. Facebook compresses the video that plays a vital role in optimizing the storage space and sustaining the servers. It is one of the primary reasons **Facebook videos blurry Chrome.**

### Internet Instability

The Facebook videos offer good quality content depending upon the internet connection. The faster connection means the high-quality videos load quicker. Therefore, do check your connection if your concern is **why are my uploaded Facebook videos blurry.**

### Limited Space on Device

Another significant cause of **Facebook videos' blurry Android** is the storage space in the device. If your device offers limited memory, the videos appear pixelated, blurry, and scrambled.

The section is sketched out for you if you are an Android user. Whenever you run into a pixelated and scrambled video, you question yourself, "**why are Facebook videos scrambled**?" There are three methods to nip the issue in the bud once and for all.
