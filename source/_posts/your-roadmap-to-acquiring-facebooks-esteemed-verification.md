## Part 1: What is the Blue Verification Badge

The blue verification badge is a seal of your identity. It proves that your pages have a real identity and not fake. Facebook has [three kinds of verification](https://www.facebook.com/help/196050490547892?helpref=popular%5Ftopics) – grey tick pages, blue tick pages, and blue tick profiles.

**The grey tick Facebook pages** represent various organizations and companies that have been verified by Facebook and confirm their real identity.

**The blue tick Facebook pages and Facebook profiles** confirm the identity of the public figures, media, and brands as per their claim. The badge confirms their official pages.

Confirming your Facebook identity verification is important because [it’s a quick sign that your business, brand, or profile is doing well](https://www.weboptimizers.com.au/blue-tick-verification/) and deserve to earn a verifying sign. When your customers or any users check a verified sign on your page, they know that the page they are looking at is not fake. The page is not created by any fraud or fan and it is the real profile or page of a person or company. When the clients seek customer service, the verified Facebook pages show that the company is serious about its client relationship and social media marketing. It also helps your page to rank higher on Google search as well as Facebook search.

**Are you eligible**? [Facebook verification is not allowed for all](https://www.facebook.com/help/1288173394636262). As per the Support Team of Facebook, the verified badge is only available for famous businesses or brands, journalists, media, celebrities, Government officials, sports companies, and people related to the entertainment world. Are you under any of these categories? Then, follow the [Facebook terms of service](https://www.facebook.com/terms) you get a higher chance of being verified quickly.
