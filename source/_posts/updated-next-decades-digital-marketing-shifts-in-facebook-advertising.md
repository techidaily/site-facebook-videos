### Chatbots

A [Kolsky study](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/vala-afshar/50-important-customer-exp%5Fb%5F8295772.html) finds that attracting a new customer is 6-7 times more expensive than retaining a current one. The key to great customer service is promptness and knowledgeability. This is where chatbots come in handy. You can get more bang for your buck with a chatbot. If you have a customer service team, then you can use chatbots to filter out basic, tedious, and repetitive questions. Additionally, the chatbot can make the customers' experience feel personalized. The customer service reps can then handle difficult or technical queries.
