TikTok is the fastest growing app in the world that has caught all the gen Z into its whirlwind with the concept of content creation. Most people near us are influencers or content creators who create interesting short videos to entertain people all around the globe.

With an interface similar to Snapchat, TikTok allows you to add filters, sounds, and effects to your 15-second TikTok videos. Even if you don’t hold an account, you can watch thousands of videos on Tik Tok.

But most importantly, as a content creator, you can also share those videos with people on your other social media platforms, such as Facebook. In this article, we will show you how you can share a TikTok video on Facebook.

Part 3: [How Can YouShare Tik Tok Videos to Facebook without Watermark](#step3)

## Part 1: Social Media Integration

The Social Media Industry has grown exponentially with a new app every few years or so. But, TikTok has introduced a new trend that was unheard of before. The content creation angle of it all has empowered everyone to show their skills to the world and entertain all the users on every platform.

What makes social media so powerful is the integration. Users are on so many different apps that it feels like an entirely different virtual universe. To cope with all that, Influencers need to create impactful content that reaches the maximum number of people.

An excellent way to do that is social media integration. A single media file can be shared on multiple platforms to ensure a good reach, which will boost your followers. For example, if you share a TikTok to Facebook, anyone you aren't on TikTok can enjoy it too. With a well-integrated social media presence, your followers will grow over the years.

If you are new to content creation, this article will show you how you can share TikTok to Facebook stories or news feeds.

### To Remove Watermark from Tiktok Videos on iPhone and Android

Most software these days only allow you to remove watermarks in their premium versions, where you might have to pay some extra bucks to avail that feature. But Apowersoft Recorder allows you to do that for free.

The software is extremely easy to use, and you can remove any text, logos, or unnecessary objects from your video. You can save the video from TikTok without the logo and username on it. Just follow the simple steps below to remove watermarks from your video.

1\. Download the [ApowerREC](https://www.apowersoft.com/record-all-screen)app on your phone and launch it.

2\. Tap on the settings icon in the button on the right corner of your screen.
