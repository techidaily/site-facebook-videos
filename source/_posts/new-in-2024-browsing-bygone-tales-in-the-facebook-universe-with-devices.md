## Part 4: How to Save Posts from Your Stories Archive to Your Device?

We tend not to save stories to our devices when clicking them directly from the Facebook app. However, you can save a post to your device from the stories archive using simple steps. Let's see how to do it:

**Step 1: Click on your archives**

When you open the Facebook mobile app, you will see your **archive** option on the **top right**. Click on it to **view your old stories**.

**Step 2: Click on a story**

After visiting the story archive, click on the story you wish to save. Click on the **three dots** on the top right.

**Step 3: Save story**

After you click three dots, you will see a save and delete photo option. Click on the **save option** to download it to your device.

## Part 5: How to See Old Stories on a Facebook Business Page?

Facebook business pages help in enhancing business significantly, primarily if you use story features for customer interaction. If you want to keep track of old stories, you can use the following method:

**Step 1: Go to your Page**

Open your page and click on **publishing tools** in the menu given in the top bar.

**Step 2: Click on the story archive**

On the top left, you will see a **story archive** option; click on it.

**Step 3: View story**

When you click on the story **archive**, you will see all your old stories in sequential order; click to view.

**Conclusion**

Facebook is an excellent platform to interact with your audience, and the story is one of the best features to give your friends a glimpse of your life. Going through old stories can refresh a lot of our memories. If you did not know how to see old stories on Facebook, now you do.
