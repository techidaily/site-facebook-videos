#### 1. Open Ads Manager

You’ll need to start in [Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/282701548912119), which is connected with your Facebook account and can be found on your home page in the left menu.

![where to find Facebook Ads Manager ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-ads-manager.jpg)

Click on the   **Ads**  tab, and the **Create** button to get started. You can’t miss it - it’s **bright green**! You’ll be asked if you want to choose Guided Creation or Quick Creation. Either way is pretty easy to do, and you can experiment with both when you begin to see which works best for you.

![Facebook Campaign Creation Guide Types ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-do-you-want-to-create-ad-campaigns.jpg)

In the following part, I’ll show you the steps after clicking Select Guided Creation for detailed explanation.

At first, you’ll need to select campaign objective, which is what you would like to result from your video ad. Choosing the right one here can be tricky, but [here’s a guide to help you out](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1438417719786914). Some possible marketing objectives to choose from include:

* Brand Awareness
* Reach
* Traffic
* Engagement
* Lead Generation

![choosing Facebook campaign marketing objective ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-campaign-marketing-objective.jpg)

Depending on what exactly you want to achieve from your ad, you’ll select a particular objective.

Depending on the objective you choose, your pricing could be different.

You will also be promoted to specify an audience that you want your ad to target. You’ll have to select info such as location, age, and demographic.

#### 2. Choosing A Format

Once you’ve gone through the initial info, you need to choose a format for your ad. You have a few specific options to choose from:

Note: if you’ve enabled the Dynamic Creative option under Conversion in Ad Set tab, you’ll see the Single Image or Video format option only, since the Dynamic Creative allows you to upload individual images and headlines and generate combination automatically. Here, we’ll choose Single Image or Video format to show the next steps. Once you’ve got the hang of it, you can experiment with the other two.

#### 3\.  Adding Your Media & Elements

If you want to create a video, the process is a little different, but not much more complicated.

#### 4\.  Creating Your Video with Templates

If you choose use [video ad template](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create a video, you will see lot of different options for you to choose from.

#### 5\. Customizing Your Video Creation Kit Template

Simply click on each picture and choose **+Select Image** under the **Background** heading. Be aware that you can’t use the images they’ve put in as placeholders, no matter how much you may like them!

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If you’ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!

### Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?

As we said before, Facebook has billions daily users, and here are just a few reasons to start using this as a platform to get your videos out there:

* Facebook is regarded as the most important network for marketers, beating LinkedIn by a whopping 46%
* Facebook video get, on average, over [8 billion daily views](https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/04/facebook-video-views/)
* Viewers are 1.5 times more likely to watch video on smartphones than on a computer
* Video makes up just 3% of the content on Facebook, but has the highest engagement rate

No matter what your business, video is a tool you should be taking advantage of, and with stats like these, Facebook is a great place to start getting your video ads out there!

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If you’ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!

### Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If you’ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!
