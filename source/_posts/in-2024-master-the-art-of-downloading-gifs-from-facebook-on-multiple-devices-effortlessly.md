## Part 3:Download GIF from Facebook on iPhone

Apple has put a tight grip on the things a user can perform on their devices, that’s why iPhone users are not allowed to download videos and images directly from the internet on to the internal storage of the device. Downloading GIFs from Facebook and saving it onto your iPhone will require you to follow the steps exactly as I mention down here.

1\. Open the Facebook app on your iPhone.

2\. Now head over to the GIF you want to download.

![head over gif on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/head-over-gif5.jpg)

4\. Facebook will open the GIF in the internal browser window, where you will see the three-dotted menu icon at the top right corner.

The GIF image will be downloaded on your iPhone and saved into the Camera Roll. Now you can easily share the GIF with anyone you like, head over to the GIF image in the Camera Roll, and press the share button on the image to select the app on which you want to share the GIF.

2\. Clip out a short section that you want to use. Make sure the message you want to convey is evident in the small chunk of video, as there won’t be any sound.

3\. Mute the audio by right-clicking the video in the timeline and selecting the “Mute” option or by the shortcut “Ctrl+Shift+M.”

Tips:

Facebook and other social media platforms have different limitations on how large GIFs can be uploaded, so keep the GIF file size at 5MB or under that.

## Conclusion

GIFs allow people to express their emotions where words lag. In the age of social media, you often come across GIFs on Facebook and would love to share it with friends on other platforms directly. But if you don’t know how to download GIF from Facebook it can be a bit disappointing not being able to share the GIF meme you loved. Fortunately, that isn’t the case anymore as you have learned how to download Facebook GIF effectively any of your digital devices.
