**Note:** Before switching over to the guide, make sure that the video you wish to upload strictly follows the specifications discussed in the last session.

**Step 2:** In your FB profile page, click on the **“Change Cover”** option. Select the **“Upload photo/Video”** option from the drop-down. Few minutes would take for the processing.

**Step 3:** Reposition the part of the video you wish to be placed in the center once the video is uploaded. A simple drag and drop action would do this. Once done, click on the **"Next"** button.

**Step 4:** Before hitting off the Publish button to complete the task, choose a perfect thumbnail. From the frame's collection, slide the arrow over to the left or right side and select a frame of your choice. After the selection, hit the **"Publish"** button, and it's over!

You have now successfully uploaded the FB cover video to your profile.

* **Make it unique, but Professional:** Social media is a place to go crazy, and fun but never go off-brand or too stupid.
* **Prepare your video to be played mute**: Frequently, Facebook cover videos are watched through mobile in an on-the-go process, leading to watched videos in silence. People watch 85% of videos without sounds, hence prepare your video to play without relying on it.
* **Make it magical or animated:** Animated videos are the best magicians to provoke a magical touch. With just still images, they bring a new world alive before our eyes.
* **Showcase your product personality:** Video being dynamic than photos, **FB cover videos** are the best place to showcase your brand products and services.

### Conclusion

Thus, this Facebook cover video is an excellent add-on that proves to be an engaging tool in grabbing notice and spectators towards your account. Facebook being the first social media network to rock the floor, continues to be top on the line with additional features that are good-to-go!
