## Part 2: Tips That Can Help You Create Best Animated Facebook Ads

Creating **animated Facebook ads** is not just about working with the best tools. While designing your advertisements with the appropriate tools, you are required to have the potential and the knowledge to create the **best animated Facebook ads.** For this, there are several tips that can be realized and adopted by them which would help them **create animated Facebook ads** to perfection.

### Targeting a Specific Audience

While setting up an advertisement, it is very important to understand the audience that will be interacting with the advertisement. As Facebook can be effectively utilized for targeting a specific audience, thanks to its targeted ad campaigns, the design of the **animated Facebook ads** needs to be highly relevant to the audience that is to be subjectively discussed within it.

### Setting Time for Running Ads

Displaying ads at the perfect time gives you the best returns, all in all. Users need to look through their Facebook Analytics and come up with the best options of time scales that will be used for running ads across their accounts. With times having the highest traffic, brands can expect the highest returns across these time periods.

### Utilize Facebook Canvas Ads

The use of Facebook Canvas Ads is believed to be highly profitable in terms of the numbers associated with it. People have reportedly explained a considerable percentage of viewers to be looking into Canvas Ads for a greater time as compared to other advertisement styles. Although an advertisement contains the appropriate videos, photos, GIFs, and call-to-actions, defining the style and format of the advertisement holds similar importance.

### Using Social Proof

Animated ads are not generally focused on adding realistic frames and videos within them. However, adding social proof across your ads makes them more relevant and acknowledged by the consumer. People usually look for realistic proof before trusting a certain brand. Having such social proofs within your ads that would build up the trust of the consumer is promoted on all scales.

### Focusing on Retargeting Campaigns

Retargeting campaigns is not a common concept among most users. People usually work across their product and fail to gain the attention of their visitors. However, with the use of retargeting campaigns, people who are generally aware of the tool or product can be allured back into the system with ads that would be highly interactive. However, users need to make sure that the message within the ad is still relevant to their cause and target audience.

### Creating Lookalikes of Your Audience

After setting up a proper target audience for your product or service, the user needs to proceed with setting up their lookalikes of the defined audience. Using such an approach is generally consistent and highly profitable, as this would help brands reach out to the problems of the audience and help them target the points that would effectively bring the attention of the viewer into the system.

### Do a Clear Analysis of the Competitors

It is quite important to be aware of what your competitors are up to. For this, an analysis of the ads of competitors is necessary. This would help you point out the reason that led to the success or failure of their advertisement. Following this, you would realize the factors that would help you ensure the success of your ad. Users need to work on making sure that the elements and techniques used across their ads are completely relevant to the **animated Facebook ads** standards.
