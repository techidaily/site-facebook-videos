As we have mentioned, ads might appear before, during, or after the video. So hence, **FB instream ads** have various formats. Let us introduce them to you.

**Pre-Roll Ads**

Ads that are played before the video starts are known as Pre-Roll ads. People who seek out content actively are mostly shown these ads. The more you seek out content, the more you receive these ads.

Ads that play during the video are referred to as Mid-Roll ads. If your video has natural breakpoints, then this ad format works best.

**Image Ads**

Lastly, the ads that play at the end of the video are known as Post-Roll Ads. These ads are mostly shown to those viewers who have not received any pre-roll, mid-roll, or image ad.

## Part 2\. Instream Ads for Live

As we have mentioned, ads might appear before, during, or after the video. So hence, **FB instream ads** have various formats. Let us introduce them to you.

**Pre-Roll Ads**

Ads that are played before the video starts are known as Pre-Roll ads. People who seek out content actively are mostly shown these ads. The more you seek out content, the more you receive these ads.

**Mid-Roll Ads**

Ads that play during the video are referred to as Mid-Roll ads. If your video has natural breakpoints, then this ad format works best.

**Image Ads**

Some ads are displayed under the content. These ads are static and are known as Image Ads. These types of ads work best for videos that cannot adjust mid-roll ads.

**Post-Roll Ads**

Lastly, the ads that play at the end of the video are known as Post-Roll Ads. These ads are mostly shown to those viewers who have not received any pre-roll, mid-roll, or image ad.

## Part 2\. Instream Ads for Live

It is a common practice that Facebook Pages do live streams where they answer your question or do live chat. What you don’t know is that you can place **Facebook in-stream** **ads** before or during your live stream. Before you start the live session, you can select if you want to show or not show any ads. If you don't know how that's done, then follow the steps shared below.

**Step 1**: First of all, head over to ‘Live Producer’ and set your stream. Now, you can access the instream ads from the dashboard of Live Producer under the Monetization section.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 2**: Next, for accessing the default in-stream ad settings of your Page, you need to click on the expand icon. The icon will be visible within the widget.

**Step 3**: Now, in Creator Studio, click on the 'Monetization' tab. There, select 'Instream ads' and hit the option of 'Settings.' You can toggle on the option so that default ads are included.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 4**: Lastly, you can go live and enjoy because the **instream Facebook** ad settings are complete.

Once your live stream is complete, you can save the video to your Page. While saving and publishing the video, you will have an option to either include the ads or not include them.

![add instream ads or not](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-instream-ads-4.jpg)

There is one important thing that you should know. If you have turned off in-stream ads, then you cannot change the settings during the live session. Whereas, for mid-roll ads, you can toggle them on or off even during the broadcast.
