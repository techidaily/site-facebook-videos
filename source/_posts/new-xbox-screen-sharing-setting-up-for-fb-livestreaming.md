### Method 2:Streaming Xbox to computer with a capture card

You can find many [capture cards](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming)in the market which would allow you to stream your Xbox onto your computer without altering its quality. HD60 Pro is one of those capture cards which offers perfect streaming and optimum control for an enhanced gaming experience.

## Use Wirecast or OBS to stream your desktop to Facebook

Once all is set up you can live stream you desktop screen to facebook, we are not going to give a full introdcution here, you can check _OBS setup here,_ and _Wirecast setup here._

[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) \- is one of the best free and open source applications for live streaming and video recording. It comes with loads of useful features like real time audio/video capture, special filters for colour corrections, audio mixers and much more.

**Pros**\- Its is a powerful free software which includes the tutorials

**Cons**\- It doesn’t offer any support and it would take you a long time to master the settings.
