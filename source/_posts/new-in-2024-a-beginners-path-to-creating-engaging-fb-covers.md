First of all, videos are the effective mediums that are eye-catching and attention-grabbers that can convey things in just seconds.

Finally, besides products, service advertising, and business experts, these Facebook cover videos are beneficial to people who wish to showcase their talent. Are you an artist in art/craft, singing expert, musician, or photographer? Facebook page cover videos are the best platforms for the world to know you and your talents.

## Facebook Cover Video Specifications

Excited to know about the feature of FB cover video? Are you getting ready to upload one? Ensure that your cover video meets the below specification for successful accomplishment.

**Note:** Uploading a cover video to your Facebook account is possible only through your desktop or computer.

Facebook allows uploading of cover videos, which are at least 20 but less than 90 seconds long. Videos beyond this time limit would result in the unsuccessful upload.

The resolution should meet 1080 Pixels for the bright appearance over the frame. Like cover propping done by Facebook is 820 \* 462 pixels. Hence, align your video well so that all the essential images and text portraying your product/talent get centralized within the frame.

Avoid awkward transitions as the cover photos will automatically be played off on the loop. Make sure that the video has started and ends with a natural loop. If looping isn't possible, simply turn off the automatic replay option. If you are viewing the cover video from the computer, 75 pixels will get removed from the top and bottom; so, one has to click on it to view the full-dimensional one. But on the mobile, the full video is made visible.

For easy understanding and a clear demonstration, we have built-up the specifications in the form of a table below.

| # | Factor                   | Specification                  |

| 4 | Minimum Dimension        | 820\*312 Pixels                |
| 5 | Recommended Video Format | .mp4 or .mov                   |
| 6 | Aspect Ratio             | 16:9                           |

## Why Use a Facebook Cover Video?

This unique feature from Facebook aids in creating interactions and a wow factor among your followers and friends. The cover page is the most creative spot where one can experience the richness and grab attention from the first time viewers or the audience becomes dashing if your FB account has a cover video. So, are there any other benefits by the usage of this Facebook page cover video? If this is your question from your side, here is a session, especially for you.

First of all, videos are the effective mediums that are eye-catching and attention-grabbers that can convey things in just seconds. While extensive data becomes impossible to reach the audience, Facebook cover videos become helpful portrayers that could deliver information easily-digestible dynamically. Instead of going through the about page, and album illustrating about oneself, your cover video would speak about you in seconds.

Second, if you are a business expert or service provider who wishes to get contacts and connect to people, these Facebook cover videos are of great assistance. You can showcase your products that could facilitate the selling of products, sharing them with others, leading to increased popularity and followers count. You can introduce your team, tour your location, and describe a service your office or organization offers.

You can also showcase your organization or company in the cover video. The most exceptional example is none other than the cover video by National Geographic. It has uploaded a scenery video as a point on advertising its newest magazine. This type of cover videos takes off a considerable audience crowd giving a magical touch.

## Facebook Cover Video Specifications

Excited to know about the feature of FB cover video? Are you getting ready to upload one? Ensure that your cover video meets the below specification for successful accomplishment.

**Note:** Uploading a cover video to your Facebook account is possible only through your desktop or computer.

Facebook allows uploading of cover videos, which are at least 20 but less than 90 seconds long. Videos beyond this time limit would result in the unsuccessful upload.

The resolution should meet 1080 Pixels for the bright appearance over the frame. Like cover propping done by Facebook is 820 \* 462 pixels. Hence, align your video well so that all the essential images and text portraying your product/talent get centralized within the frame.

Avoid awkward transitions as the cover photos will automatically be played off on the loop. Make sure that the video has started and ends with a natural loop. If looping isn't possible, simply turn off the automatic replay option. If you are viewing the cover video from the computer, 75 pixels will get removed from the top and bottom; so, one has to click on it to view the full-dimensional one. But on the mobile, the full video is made visible.

For easy understanding and a clear demonstration, we have built-up the specifications in the form of a table below.

| # | Factor                   | Specification                  |
| - | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1 | Time Limit               | Between 20 and 90 seconds long |
| 2 | Resolution               | 1080 Pixels                    |
| 3 | Length                   | 820\*462 Pixels                |
| 4 | Minimum Dimension        | 820\*312 Pixels                |
| 5 | Recommended Video Format | .mp4 or .mov                   |
| 6 | Aspect Ratio             | 16:9                           |
| 7 | Width\*Height            | 640\*360 Pixels                |
