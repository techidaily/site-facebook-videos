## Increasing Likes & Shares: Facebook's Best Practices

If you're like most business owners, you've set up a Facebook Page for your company and are eager to start using it to reach new customers. But how can you make sure that your Page is seen by as many people as possible? And how can you make sure that it appears at the top of the search engine results pages (SERPs)?

Here are a few simple steps that you can take to improve your Facebook Page's visibility and rank it higher in the SERPs.

## Part 1\. Make sure your Facebook Page is properly set up

![set up facebook page properly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/set-up-facebook-page-properly.jpg)

Facebook is a powerful marketing tool for businesses, and a properly set-up page can help you to rank higher in search results and reach more potential customers.

To start with, make sure that your page includes all of the essential information, such as your business name, address, and contact information. Next, take some time to fill out your profile completely, and include a compelling description of your business.

Then, start posting relevant, high-quality content on a regular basis. As your page becomes more popular, you'll start to see an increase in your Facebook ranking.

By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your Facebook page is working hard for you.

## Part 2\. Use keywords in your Page's title and description

![use keyword facebook page title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/use-keyword-facebook-page-title.jpg)

When you're trying to rank your Facebook page, one of the most important things you can do is to use keywords in your Page's title and description.

This helps Facebook's algorithms understand what your Page is about, and it also helps to get your Page in front of people who are searching for those keywords. Of course, you don't want to stuff your title and description with keywords - that will just make your Page look spammy. Instead, focus on using a few key phrases that accurately describe what your Page is all about. And make sure that those phrases are prominently featured in both your title and description.

With a little keyword optimization, you can help ensure that your Facebook page ranks high in search results - and that more people see and engage with your content.

![prompt facebook page social media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/prompt-facebook-page-social-media.jpg)

As a business owner, you know that social media is a powerful tool for promoting your brand and reaching new customers. And when it comes to Facebook, one of the best ways to get more exposure for your Page is to promote it on other social media platforms.

By sharing your Page on Twitter, Instagram, and other sites, you can reach a wider audience and encourage more people to like and follow your Page. Additionally, you can also use paid advertising on social media to target potential customers and get your Page in front of them.

When done correctly, promoting your Facebook Page on other social media platforms can be a great way to increase your ranking and get more visibility for your business.

As any social media expert will tell you, one of the keys to maintaining a high ranking on Facebook is to regularly add fresh, relevant content. This not only keeps your page active and engaging, but it also helps Facebook's algorithms to see your page as valuable and worth promoting. Of course, posting quality content can be a challenge, especially if you're running a busy page.

However, there are a few simple strategies you can use to make sure your content is always top-notch. First, try to vary the types of content you post, mixing up text posts, photos, and videos. Second, take advantage of trending topics and hashtags to ensure your content is timely and relevant.

If you're serious about making your Facebook page rank, then you need to be monitoring your page's analytics. This will give you a clear picture of how your page is performing and where it needs to improve. There are a number of different metrics you should be tracking, including your page views, likes, and shares.

By monitoring these metrics, you'll be able to see which content is resonating with your audience and which content isn't. You can also use this data to adjust your content strategy and ensure that your page is consistently delivering high-quality content that helps it rank.
