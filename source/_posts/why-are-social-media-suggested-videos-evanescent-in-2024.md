## Part 1\. Reasons for Facebook Suggested Videos Not Showing Up

![reasons for suggested videos not showing up](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-suggested-videos-not-showing-up-1.jpg)

There is another section on Facebook that holds a variety of videos. The section keeps an eye on you. It only consists of videos for fun and entertainment. It has been reported sometimes that the **Facebook suggested videos not showing up.** In any such scenario, we always figure out a way to watch the videos, but no one bothers to know about the reasoning factors that have caused this problem.

In this section of the article, we will highlight the various reasons why Facebook suggested videos are not showing up.

### 1\. Improper Launching

One resulting factor that might cause your **Facebook suggested videos not to show up** is the improper launch of the application. Sometimes improper launch hinders your way and blocks the view of suggested videos.

You should always try to treat the problem on time. You are suggested to follow the given solutions for this particular problem because you never know what might work for you. First of all, you should log out from Facebook, and you can also delete the browser completely. After that, you should install it fresh. You should also restart your system. Then give it some time to work properly.

### 2\. Poor Network Signals

A very common reason observed for **FB suggested videos not showing up** is the weak connection. This is the most accurate reason for many Facebook problems. Not just this issue but with poor network signals, you might also face some other troubles.

The best thing to tackle this problem is selecting a good and strong connection environment. With this solution, you can avoid many other problems as well, including this problem. With a stronger network connection, refresh the page because it increases the chance to view the videos.

### 3\. Insufficient Space

As we mentioned earlier, there is a complete section of random entertaining videos. It consists of hundreds of videos that it has to buffer at once. Facebook videos need buffering to get played, and for that, they require quite the space.

If you don't have sufficient space, this might be the resulting factor for **Facebook suggested videos not showing up.** This is the reason that causes the delay in loading the videos on time.

### 4\. Cache problems

A corrupt cache is another big reason why your Fb suggested videos don't show up. Cache or even the cookies also slow down the performance of your favorite application. As with corrupt cache and cookies, the application does not work like it usually works efficiently.

For this scenario, the suggested solution is to stop Facebook forcefully. Once that is done, now it’s time to clear and empty the cache for applications' better performance.

### 5\. Update Required

The last reason that might be causing this problem is the old version of Facebook. This tip is specifically for iPhone and also Android users. This trouble is very common as most people forget to Update the applications, which in return causes some problems.

One such problem is **FB suggested videos not showing up.** In this case, all the Android and iPhone users should update Facebook and then check the suggested videos after an update.

## Part 2\. How Does Facebook Determine Which Videos Are Suggested for You?

As mentioned earlier, Facebook has a section where various hundreds of videos are available. You can easily access that tab and enjoy and entertain yourself with those videos. We also mentioned that this video section keeps an eye on you.

The coming section of this article will walk you through several factors on the basis on which the suggested videos are displayed. Let’s get started.

### 1\. Videos Popularity

The number 1 reason that how could some random videos make their way to your suggested videos is the popularity of any particular video.

Any video that offers entertainment, good and quality content, motivation quotes or speech, some kind of love-hate poetry. Even compilation videos of different sports, matches, funny moments, and a lot more things can fall in this category that gets the fame.

So, any famous or trending video that a lot of Facebook users have viewed, shared, liked, or commented on will automatically make its way to your and others' suggested video tab. This is how random videos show up in your suggested videos.

### 2\. People and Pages You Follow

Another factor that aids in bringing random videos to your Facebook suggested videos section is whom you follow and like. Like the real world, Facebook is that platform where every person has their own identify, their accounts. Every business, different startups have their pages. Influencers have pages from where they can spread their voice through their content.

Being Facebook users, we follow different pages and follow different people as well. We add different friends on Facebook as it is the social media platform that aims to provide connectivity. So hence, in simple words, we are surrounded by many different personalities who have entirely different approaches, preferences, likes, and dislikes.

Several videos in your suggested video section come from the people and pages you are surrounded by. The pages and people whom you follow there liked and viewed videos end up in your videos section too.

## Part 3\. How Can You Customize the Suggested Videos Yourself?

Whenever we sit and scroll on Facebook to kill, sometimes we actually end up killing hours of our day. Facebook is that hub where you will find unlimited entertainment in all categories. Once you involve yourself in that, you cannot easily get out of it.
