Effects such as the Beauty Brushy Pack, Beauty Makeup Pack, Yoga pack, Food BBQ Pack, Power Pack etc. are going to make your profile video all the more compelling. These packs would allow you to create fascinating overlays, titles, elements and transitions to make your profile video more impressive.

 Now let us take a quick look at how to add an element to your profile video on Wondershare Filmora.

![filmora elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-filmora.jpg)

* First you need to hit the Elements tab in the tool bar and then choose the elements you want to use and drag them to the PIP track. For instance here I am selecting Element Emoji 8.

![filmora elements emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-emoji.jpg)

* Now you need to double click the above mentioned element on the timeline and then choose an animated effect for the Emoji effect. Now hit the OK button. One can also choose to hit the Advanced button for editing the Mask and Green Screen effect from the PIP edit.

* The size and the position of the Emoji element needs to be adjusted accordingly.

 Note: It needs to be noted here that you will be able to zoom in and zoom out the timeline so as to view all the clips in the timeline with clarity. In case the duration of the video is lengthy then you can alter the duration of the still photos or cut some of the clips from the video footage. In order to use other effects like overlays and filters you just need to depend on Filmora.

#### 3\. Saving your video to the device

 Once you are done with the editing of your footage you need to hit the Export button for output. Since the Facebook profile video can only be uploaded through an iOS or Android smartphone, you will be required to select the Device in the left panel of the Export Window and then choose your device.

![export output](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-output.jpg)

 Note: Remember that the export isn’t going to transfer the videos to your mobile device directly. The video is going to be stored in the local hard disk.
