## Part 1: The Basic Specifications of a Facebook Cover Video

When developing a **Facebook header video,** a few special dynamics of such videos are to be followed to the root. To avoid any issue with your video's potential upload across the platform, some basic specifications need to be covered across the cover video. Being a public video, anyone in the platform can effectively view the video; thus, introducing everyone to what the business intends to offer its customers.

![facebook cover video details](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-cover-video-1.jpg)

Cover videos have been a tactic to allure new customers into the offered product or service. To ensure that the developed video is of the highest of qualities, you need to look into the specifications of a basic or **animated Facebook cover,** as shown below.

### Size of the Cover Video

There are no specified sizes of cover videos uploaded across Facebook. Considering the basic limit of Facebook, the platform allows users to upload videos as larger as 1.75GB in size. Try to choose a file size that is within the basic limits. It is preferably advised to avoid such large video files as it gets difficult for users to view the video due to slow browsing speeds.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Dimensions to Be Followed

Facebook has set a particular set of dimensions for a **Facebook banner video** that you create for your page or business. With the default requirements of 820 x 312 pixels, the optimal dimensions that are believed to be the perfect fit for a Facebook cover video are 820 x 462 pixels. Facebook resizes your video within the 16:9 aspect ratio when uploaded across the platform.

![dimension for facebook cover video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-cover-video-2.jpg)

It is highly advised that the dimensions set by Facebook should be followed for the best results. However, the Facebook mobile application has something else to say about the size of a cover video. The application cuts off the sides of the video and restricts the display to 640 x 360 pixels. To counter the issue regarding cutting off the sides of the video, users are highly advised to keep their text-centered throughout the video.

### Supported Formats

Facebook cover video operates quite similarly to a basic video upload across Facebook. With a maximum resolution of 1080p, users can utilize the MP4 and MOV file formats for uploading the Facebook video over the platform. The platform supports other file formats; however, for effective results, it is advised to keep up the use of MP4 and MOV for this purpose. Convert your Facebook cover videos if you wish to utilize these two file formats to upload your video.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Length of a Facebook Cover Video

The length of the **Facebook banner video** needs to cover a limit between 20 seconds and 90 seconds. Anything between this video limit makes the video perfect in its entirety. Being an advertisement of your business, this video length is believed to cater to the best resonance achieved from the viewers in the community. The length of the video defines the consistency of the viewer, whether they stay or do not stay by the end of the video.

### Cropping your Facebook Cover Video

You may consider using different cropping tools for managing the aspect ratio of your video. While calling out the use of this tool, the images and text of the video should be as centered as possible, saving them from being removed from the banner after cropping.

## Part 2: How to Set Up Your First Facebook Cover Video

Once you are made aware of all the important aspects of what makes a **Facebook header video** or an **animated Facebook cover,** it is time to take the responsibility of setting up the first Facebook cover video for your business. This part would feature the basic possibilities and procedural requirements to help users set up the first Facebook cover video.

The first and basic step of setting up the Facebook cover video is to have it uploaded across the platform. Before having it uploaded, ensure that the specifications of the cover video have been covered to perfection, with no particular loopholes within the video. Use the simple step-by-step procedure of uploading a Facebook video across the platform.

**Step 1:** Launch Facebook and access the page where the cover video will be uploaded. Access “Pages” from your news feed to look into the page.

### Size of the Cover Video

There are no specified sizes of cover videos uploaded across Facebook. Considering the basic limit of Facebook, the platform allows users to upload videos as larger as 1.75GB in size. Try to choose a file size that is within the basic limits. It is preferably advised to avoid such large video files as it gets difficult for users to view the video due to slow browsing speeds.

With the default requirements of 820 x 312 pixels, the optimal dimensions that are believed to be the perfect fit for a Facebook cover video are 820 x 462 pixels.

![dimension for facebook cover video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-cover-video-2.jpg)

It is highly advised that the dimensions set by Facebook should be followed for the best results. However, the Facebook mobile application has something else to say about the size of a cover video. The application cuts off the sides of the video and restricts the display to 640 x 360 pixels. To counter the issue regarding cutting off the sides of the video, users are highly advised to keep their text-centered throughout the video.

### Supported Formats

Facebook cover video operates quite similarly to a basic video upload across Facebook. With a maximum resolution of 1080p, users can utilize the MP4 and MOV file formats for uploading the Facebook video over the platform. The platform supports other file formats; however, for effective results, it is advised to keep up the use of MP4 and MOV for this purpose. Convert your Facebook cover videos if you wish to utilize these two file formats to upload your video.

### Length of a Facebook Cover Video

The length of the **Facebook banner video** needs to cover a limit between 20 seconds and 90 seconds. Anything between this video limit makes the video perfect in its entirety. Being an advertisement of your business, this video length is believed to cater to the best resonance achieved from the viewers in the community. The length of the video defines the consistency of the viewer, whether they stay or do not stay by the end of the video.
