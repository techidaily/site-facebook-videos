The presence of cache in the Facebook app is one of the most concerning root causes of this problem. Hence, one should keep on clearing the cache periodically. To clear the cache, the steps include:

**Step 1:** In this first step, hold your Android device and click on "Settings." Choose "Apps" from the diverse menu options. After that, tap on "Manage Apps."

**Step 2:** Search for "Facebook" and open it. Navigate to the "Storage" from there. The system shows the app's total size, user data, and cache.

## Part 5: How to Solve "Facebook Story Upload Failed" on iPhone?

The section allows the iPhone users to help them with the "**Facebook story upload failed"** issue. The article has designed four extensive solutions to address the problem. Let us have a glance!

### Fix 1: Reviewing the Internet Connection

The browsers and Facebook application have an internet timeout. You suffer from internet unavailability if you add the media to the Facebook story and fail to upload it. Head to the browser "Settings" so that you can check the status of your Wi-Fi or Cellular Data.
