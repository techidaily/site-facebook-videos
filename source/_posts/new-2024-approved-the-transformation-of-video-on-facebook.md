## Bonus Tip: Facebook Short Video Monetization

Ever since the ban placed on Tik Tok, Mark Zuckerberg and his team have been rolling out similar updates on all the other platforms. Facebook short videos have gained a lot of attention ever since the launch of this feature.

This feature was predominantly launched in India as a part of a testing phase and has proven to be a quite successful venture by Facebook. The short videos on Facebook also have a 30 second to 45 second run time, making them more user-friendly.

Quite recently, steps towards Facebook short video monetization have been taken. A major chunk of Facebookâ€™s revenue is generated through ads. So, a user will get money for each user then watches the Facebook short video ad played right after their 30 â€“ 45 second video.

The more viewers and followers a user has the chances of their net earnings being higher. The best way to do that is to make more engaging content; it should be socially oriented and creative.

You can also choose a particular faction of the audience and make audience-specific content. You could make music-related content for music lovers, poetry-related content for poetry lovers, and so on.

## Conclusion

Reels, Snapchat discover, and short videos on Facebook are becoming the next big thing. The 30 â€“ 45 second videos are leaving a huge impact on both the suppliers and consumers. Facebook generates revenue by monetizing these short videos, and the content creators get in touch with the world.

Although the young generation has shifted to Instagram and Snapchat, the previous generation still relies on Facebook, making introducing this feature in that sphere crucial. Short videos on Facebook have gained immense popularity in India and will continue to grow.
