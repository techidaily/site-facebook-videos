## Part 1: How to Schedule a Facebook Live?

Scheduling a live video is where you plan a live stream on a particular time slot. Keep note that live video scheduling is only possible through a PC. You will also have to use the Google Chrome web browser for the same. Now that you know the pre-requisites, let's comprehend the process in detail.

* To schedule a live video, click on the "What's on your mind?" option. It's situated just above the News Feed.
* Following that, click on the Live video option.
* Now, click on the "Schedule live video event" option. It's present in the left column.
* Within the left column, choose the location where you want to stream your live video. You will get options like timeline, page, or group. If you want to upload a live video on your timeline, select the same. Likewise, for a group or page, select the options accordingly.
* Assign a name to the event. Also, choose other details like the date and time for your live streaming. After that, select the privacy setting for your live stream.
* Click on Next. To add pictures to your live video announcement, click on "Upload Cover Photo" or "Choose illustration". Likewise, a default image will be selected if you do not want a special picture as your cover photo.
* Once done, click on the Create Event button. This is present on the bottom side of the left corner. Your live stream will be scheduled.

Once you schedule a live video, two posts will be generated automatically. This includes an announcement post and the live video post.
