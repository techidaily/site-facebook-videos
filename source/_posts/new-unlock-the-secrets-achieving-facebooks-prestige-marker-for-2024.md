## Part 4: Why Facebook Didn’t Give Verification to Me

Facebook said verification can be accepted or rejected. The grey badge verification request takes around 48 hours and the blue badge verification request needs around 3 to 45 days to receive the Facebook response. In case, your verification request is rejected, it is due to the following reasons.

      * **Press releases or marketing is less** \- When your press is less, it is highly possible that your verification request is rejected as your business or page is not identified accurately. You must learn to get featured on Techcrunch, Forbes, etc. You can also [write a press release to get exposure](https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-press-releases-examples-templates/). You may also hire my digital marketing agency for the same.
      * **Your Wikipedia is missing** \- In order to create a Wiki; you firstly require the high-quality press.
      * **Your identity proof is not up to the mark** \- When your reason for verification request is not very compelling or the ID provided by you is blurry or inappropriate, your request may get rejected.
      * **Missing Facebook Native Content** \- Facebook hates a dead page. So, it is important that your page is filled with relevant and great content for long.
      * **Verification is Strict** \- Facebook only verifies the popular pages and profiles easily if you can establish your popularity. It is very strict on who they verify.
