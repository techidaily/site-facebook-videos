But the truth is that you need not to buy any expensive camera unit to produce 360 photos for your Facebook post. It doesn’t even require a special 360 degree app to upload interactive pictures.

 Probably you have a tablet or phone that support Facebook live 360 video feature. Actually as per the recent announcement made by Facebook professionals regarding its updated applications, live 360 is compatible with all devices launched after iPad Pro. iPad Air, iPad Mini 2 or iPhone 4S models. Till now Facebook has not revealed any news related to compatibility of new features over Android devices and chances are that Android users need to wait so long to enjoy this feature on their device.

## Taking 360 Photos on iPhone and iPad With Built in Camera App

 Generally 360 degree camera is most preferable choice for developing high quality 360 degree images but in case if you don’t have one then Panorama feature of built in device cameras can make it possible. However, users cannot get focus from up and down but they can at least pan from right to left by simply swiping on their display. This feature only works for photos that mean you cannot develop 360 videos using Panorama.

 If you are using iPad or iPhone then simple open your camera app and go to Panorama Shooting mode. Start capturing your photo with panoramic photo option but note that you have to follow Facebook photo dimension specifications to develop a live 360 compatible content. However, it is really hard to measure exact dimensions of a panoramic photo when you are working with default settings.

 As soon as you have captured your desired shot, move to your Facebook account and browse photo library. Choose your recently captured panorama photo and then follow instructions provided on screen to update your video. You can also preview your content, now add desired caption and publish your content online. Soon your will start receiving interesting comments and reviews from audience. Users can also delete their 360 degree photos after few hours as per their need. Such types of videos are being commonly used for entertainment and marketing purpose throughout the world.
