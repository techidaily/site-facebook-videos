![types of facebook scam](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-video-scam-1.jpg)

However, the only responsibility of recognizing and reporting the viruses is to look into the types, which would explain quite much to the users how they need to assess the situation and protect themselves from the problems this can cause.

### Personal Messages with Urgency

Social engineers utilize their skills to express urgency across Facebook messages to gain users' personal information. Although **Facebook video scam** is different kind of scam, such types are more confusing and irritating to counter. Urgent personal messages have been an effective form of viruses fraudsters have used to gain personal information from Facebook messages.

This form of the virus has turned out to be a conventional virus type; however, only a single download was what could breach your personal information. Your account would be breached over a single click, and you'll be countering a problem that might never get easy on you.

### Facebook Video Scam Viruses

**Facebook video scam** has been at the forefront of viruses, where it has breached a lot of users' privacy with its simple yet effective technique of gaining personal information. Facebook warns its users of the possible risks before redirecting to another website; however, this has been one of the most confusing viruses. Users usually fail to realize the threats associated with moving towards other websites.

Hackers are quite successful in displaying such video scams as YouTube links that opened would redirect towards downloading a malicious file. Many people have reportedly explained the similarity with the original content, making the **Facebook video scam** one of the most threatening Facebook viruses.

### Fake Facebook Applications

People with little knowledge of Facebook applications have even breached their privacy with fake Facebook applications. The renowned icon has been copied and utilized in different forms, which, if downloaded, traps the user into the virus. If installed and opened, this virus leads you into one of the biggest and most threatening conditions.

The user who gives authorized permissions to such applications gets their phones breached to the root. A single click to installation puts your complete profile under an inadvertent threat.

### Spam Posts

Unusual posts across Facebook's timeline are another form of gaining access to your account credentials. Posts that seem too good to be true or have unrealistic patterns usually put people's profiles at risk if accessed potentially. If clicked across these posts, these online links and spam links are the killers to your profile.

Users are usually advised to report these posts on observing such suspicious activities. Although, a few put their profile at risk for winning a chance in the "online lottery."

## Part 2: What is the “Is That You” Facebook Virus and What Does it Do?

The main idea of the "Is That You" Facebook video virus is to breach the users' privacy and take in potential information that would effectively harm the image or the profile security.

### What Happens After You Click the Link or Message

This Facebook virus propagates under the narrative of gaining access to personal information or putting malicious software into the targeted system that accesses the link. While circulated as a question, this virus operates over clicking the video link usually inserted across the message.

Most people believe in the originality of this fake platform and enter their credentials across it to give away their passwords to the hackers behind it. This imitation puts in a consistent threat of getting their remote server controlled by hackers. This malicious threat is all that puts your complete profile under an imminent threat.

What looks like an original Facebook login page is just a randomly generated URL that can be recognized in many ways. The sites utilize HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is one of the simplest techniques to assume the link is a fake page to get out your information. The scam, however, extends to something beyond just getting personal information out of the user.

### What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?

This malicious software or viruses associated with the links are making money out of these potential scams. Users are tricked into giving their confidential credit card details, leading to monetary threats and scams. It has been reported that users have potentially lost money due to this mistake of letting hackers go into the account.

The developers of these viruses have an objective of personal gains out of these kinds of viruses, which can be quite a botheration for the users. The only explanation for users to stay safe from such viruses is to avoid clicking links without a clear understanding of what they are accessing. Such links lead to imitations of renowned websites, which can put you in excessive difficulties if confused with the original.

Password managers use techniques that change the credentials of your account for every site or get passwords that are random and cannot be guessed. The use of these managers is quite swift and makes it harder for hackers to break through it.

### Anti-Viruses with Built-In Web Filters

People can get tricked into having their accounts breached with such malware; however, the use of proper software can get you safely from the threats they pose. It is advised to use anti-viruses containing web filters so that URLs with malicious content cannot be accessed; thus, protecting your account integrity.

There are many ways that a password manager can be a convenient form to protect your accounts from being hacked. Password managers use techniques that change the credentials of your account for every site or get passwords that are random and cannot be guessed. The use of these managers is quite swift and makes it harder for hackers to break through it.

### Anti-Viruses with Built-In Web Filters

People can get tricked into having their accounts breached with such malware; however, the use of proper software can get you safely from the threats they pose. It is advised to use anti-viruses containing web filters so that URLs with malicious content cannot be accessed; thus, protecting your account integrity.

### Let Your Friends Know

If you think your account has been breached, you should take up a different channel to let your friends know of the problem. This would potentially help you ensure that nothing problematic occurs within your profile that would set problems for you.
