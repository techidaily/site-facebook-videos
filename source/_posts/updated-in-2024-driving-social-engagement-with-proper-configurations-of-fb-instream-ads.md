### Insights in Creator Studio

Let us first talk a little about Insights. In Creator Studio, the Insight tab shares details with you. From this tab, you get to see the information related to your Pages, earnings, Facebook content, etc. There are two different levels of detail. Either you can view the Page-Level or the Video-Level Insights. Page-level insights include the following factors.

**Audience:** Here, you can take a deeper look at your viewers, your followers. You can also view a demographic breakdown.

**Overview**: Here, you can see an overview of the Page, performance, new followers, net followers, etc. You can also find the summary of Insights for each Page.

After this, let us share with you Video Level insights and the factors that are included in them.

**Earning:** You can view the earnings insight from all your videos with instream ads.

**Performance**: Any video that you share or cross-post on your Facebook Pages, you can view its performance from metrics.

**Loyalty**: You can keep an eye on all your new followers when people are coming back to watch something or how often they are watching something.

### Understand Estimated Earning

You get Insights from the videos you upload or the videos your share on your Facebook Pages. Whereas the amount you earn from the ads in your videos is Estimated earnings. Let us dig deep.

**Estimated Earning**s: The amount one earns from ads in videos is known as Estimated Earnings. It depends on the CPM of the ads and also on the number of impressions.

**Ad CPM**: CPM is affected by the advertisers that want to reach your viewers, demographics of your audience, and also the time of the year. It is the reflection of what the advertisers are willing to pay.

**1 Minute Video Views**: This includes the total number of views on your video with ads within 1 minute or longer. 1-minute video view is important for monetization.

**Monetizable View RPM**: This is referred to as the amount you earn when your video with instream ads is viewed for more than a minute every 1000 times.
