## Part 3:Download GIF from Facebook on iPhone

Apple has put a tight grip on the things a user can perform on their devices, that’s why iPhone users are not allowed to download videos and images directly from the internet on to the internal storage of the device. Downloading GIFs from Facebook and saving it onto your iPhone will require you to follow the steps exactly as I mention down here.

1\. Open the Facebook app on your iPhone.

2\. Now head over to the GIF you want to download.

![head over gif on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/head-over-gif5.jpg)

3\. Press the link to open the GIF in the browser.

4\. Facebook will open the GIF in the internal browser window, where you will see the three-dotted menu icon at the top right corner.

![save gif on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-gif-on-iphone6.jpg)

5\. Tap the dotted overflow menu to show the options, click **“Save Image”** option from the menu to download Facebook GIF on your iPhone device.

The GIF image will be downloaded on your iPhone and saved into the Camera Roll. Now you can easily share the GIF with anyone you like, head over to the GIF image in the Camera Roll, and press the share button on the image to select the app on which you want to share the GIF.

## Part 4: Customize your GIF with Wondershare Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an astonishing video and photo editing tool both for professionals and novices alike. The intuitive interface allows anyone to understand and work smoothly with a powerful graphics engine to support heavy lifting. The editing software has numerous features like automated scene detection, hundreds of effects and filters, split-screen options, on-screen text, titles, elements, and much more. For our purpose, we will dive into the fantastic tool to make and customize our GIF with Filmora, so let’s get cracking.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![insert the source gif file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-source-gif1.jpg)

2\. Clip out a short section that you want to use. Make sure the message you want to convey is evident in the small chunk of video, as there won’t be any sound.

3\. Mute the audio by right-clicking the video in the timeline and selecting the “Mute” option or by the shortcut “Ctrl+Shift+M.”

![mute the gif file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-gif-source2.jpg)

4\. You can also put any text into your GIF by clicking on the “Title” feature in the Filmora top menu. And then select from the many formats and style options available in the Filmora library and dropping it into the timeline.

5\. You can edit the text by clicking on the text track in the timeline. It will allow you to change the color, font, size, move the text position on your GIF, and effects.

![custom gif title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/custom-gif-title4.jpg)

6\. Once you’re done with your editing and tweaking of the GIF, click on the “Export” button on the top menu and select GIF in the format type on the left pane of the popup window. And on the export window, you can change the settings to improve resolution, frame rate, and bit rate to give a vivid look and feel to your GIF.

Tips:

Facebook and other social media platforms have different limitations on how large GIFs can be uploaded, so keep the GIF file size at 5MB or under that.

## Conclusion

GIFs allow people to express their emotions where words lag. In the age of social media, you often come across GIFs on Facebook and would love to share it with friends on other platforms directly. But if you don’t know how to download GIF from Facebook it can be a bit disappointing not being able to share the GIF meme you loved. Fortunately, that isn’t the case anymore as you have learned how to download Facebook GIF effectively any of your digital devices.
