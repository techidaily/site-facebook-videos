## Why Scheduling Facebook Posts in Advance Is Necessary?

If you can publish your posts manually whenever you feel like, why schedule posts for your Facebook page?

* **To capitalize on opportunities**

As a social media marketer or a social influencer, there are always great opportunities that require you to prepare in advance. As we wait for the release of MAC Pro this December, you should have already created and scheduled a post for Facebook to attract more sales on the eve day.

* **Timing to reach a wider audience**

Many are the times when mega-events like a product launch and new product feature unveiling happen at night. During such moments, all parties (buyers, affiliates and competitors) interested in these products are busy on the internet. Publish your created Facebook post immediately after the event helps reach a wider audience.

Also, instead of staying up until late night hours to manually publish posts; just schedule your posts for Facebook.

* **Better planning and consistency**

We all plan ahead to avoid mistakes, maintain quality and ensure consistency. By scheduling Facebook post, you get enough time to create, proofread and edit posts thereby maintaining the quality of your posts.

* **Allow time for other activities**

Nothing can be as destructing as keeping your mind focused on a sensitive matter yet you have to keep your eyes on the clock. Once you get used on how to schedule a post on Facebook timeline, you shall have plenty of time to handle other activities. Concentrating on one activity boosts productivity and helps produce quality work.

Now that you clearly understand the above basics, let’s get back to our main subject:

Anyone can schedule Facebook posts using their desktops or mobile phones. The procedures involved in both hardware devices are simple if you have a Facebook page.

## How to Turn Off (Reschedule, Edit, or Delete) Scheduled Posts on Facebook

There will always be a reason for you to schedule a post in the morning and not the evening. As the extended support for Windows 7 by Microsoft draws closer (January 14, 2020), hundreds of tech-savvy writers will create and schedule posts related to Windows 7 on Facebook days before the set date.

Suppose the unexpected happens; postpone again or announce otherwise!

This is how to reschedule, edit or delete a scheduled post on Facebook

**Step 1: Open publishing tools on your Facebook page**

On your desktop browser, open your Facebook page and then click “Publishing Tools” to open your Facebook posts page.

**Step 2: Open your scheduled posts**

While on that page, click “Scheduled Posts” and select the post to reschedule, edit or delete.

**Step 3: Edit your post**

Hit the down arrow beside the "Edit" button then choose the action you want to take.

## Should You Use Third Party Tools to Schedule?

As to whether it’s safe to use third-party tools to schedule Facebook posts has been a debate amongst many marketers.

Its true Facebook used to punish people for using third-party tools back in the years on 2011\. However, it’s now certain no penalty is charged today to schedule posts using third party tools.

Another debate has been the impact of using third party tools. [Agorapulse](https://www.agorapulse.com/social-media-lab/re-test-facebook-scheduling-apps/) in this re-test ended this debate by proving that 3rd party apps outperformed Facebook direct posts by 22.61 %.

## Facebook Scheduling Quick Tips

Before you begin scheduling posts for your Facebook page, this is what you should have in mind:

* **Maintain a reasonable gap between posts**

Whereas it may be fun to post on Facebook every 30 minutes, it becomes too boring for your audience. Avoid bombarding your followers with too many posts.

* **Know the best times to publish your posts**

If you run a Facebook business page, understand when your audiences are likely to be free. Scheduling posts for early morning publication and evening after work can attract more views and reads.

* **Maintain relevance in your posts**

Your Facebook friends and followers are there because they expect certain content from you. As you schedule a post, ensure its in-line with what you advocate for or is related to your business. As in the case of KFC above, all posts are either introducing a new product or promoting an existing product.

* **Take advantage of events related to your Facebook post to as you schedule**

Do you want to triple your audience with every Facebook post? There will always be big event related to your page. Create and optimize a post related to the event and schedule it to be published immediately after or during the event.

## Conclusion

Even though scheduling Facebook posts helps save time, many people are missing the point and just setting any date and time. They don’t factor their intended results or mind using analytics to know the impact of their posts.

Now that how to schedule a post on Facebook is right at your fingertips, It’s critically important to ask yourself the following questions before you set the date and time:

1. Why schedule this post on this date and time?
2. What do I expect to achieve?
3. Will my post find the right audience during their free time?

As you answer these questions, kindly share with us how this article helped you or leave a comment on our social media platforms.
