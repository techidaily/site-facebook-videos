## What is Facebook Avatar?

Social media giant Facebook has introduced Avatars that lets users create a cartoon-look-like version of themselves. Using FB avatar can help you create a digital character that is a virtual lookalike of yourself. It is a playful and fun way for users to create a cartoon avatar of themselves. Similar to Apple’s Memoji and Snapchat’s Bitmoji, this new feature allows you to engage and react more authentically with your friends and family across the app.

## Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?

Facebook avatars, Snapchat Bitmoji and Apple Memoji are the different versions of the very same idea – each offering users a way to create cartoonish versions of their own and share with others in the conversation. Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.

Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage. But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.

FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.

![Bitmoji Collection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png)

To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji. Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.

Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.

Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.

Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.

## Quick-Fix Solutions: Why Don’t I Have a Facebook Avatar?

No option of avatars on Facebook? Wondering why Facebook avatars aren’t available to you? Fret not! Listed below are a few reasons why it isn’t working and a few ways you can get an FB avatar.

**You Need to Update Your FB App**

Oftentimes, users need to update their apps to make the most of the new features. So, if the avatar isn’t working, try updating your Facebook app. You can delete the app and reinstall it to get the latest update.

**The App Update is for Users in the US and Only a Few More Countries**

Fidji Simo, the head of the Facebook app, announced the launch of FB avatar on Facebook in the USA. Reportedly, at the time of launch, it was said that the feature is only available for users in the United States for now. However, it will not take long to reach other countries. Even though the exact dates have been kept under wraps, it will soon be rolled out worldwide.

**The Feature is Rolled Out in Phases**

Often, new updates like Facebook avatars are made available to users in phases. So, if you are a user from the US and perplexed about being unable to see the new feature, you need to bear in mind that it is likely to reach every user over time. Similarly, for users from other countries, the feature will be made available in several phases.

**Various OS: Android, iOS, etc.**

During the time of launch, it was announced that the Facebook avatar is for all Android and iOS users. However, there is a possibility that the update may not yet be visible to all FB users of different operating systems. But be relaxed. The update will soon be made available to every user with time.

### Conclusion

That’s about it. No matter whether you are in your 20s, 30s, or 50s, you can easily make your own animated character with this new update from Facebook. The new feature lets users customize their personal avatar for use as their profile picture and stickers across comments and Messenger. Time to spice up your Facebook experience using this cool feature!
