Social media apps have so much content that it almost becomes blurry while scrolling through it all. Out of all the apps, Facebook is the most used. It is one of the oldest apps with the most users and naturally has the most diversified content.

We scroll past hundreds of videos daily. Some are interesting; others are not. However, there are times when we like something so much, or we wish to watch something later. So, we tap the "Save Post" option, and it gets added to our saved list.

## Side note

Videos are a very effective way of expressing yourself. If you wish to upload your own videos to Facebook, we recommend a video editor called Wondershare Filmora. Make a video and then use Wondershare Filmora and its multitude of features to edit the video.

With Filmora, your videos can be raised to the professional level and help you interact with a larger audience.

## Conclusion

Facebook is such an all-rounded and well-thought-out application that it has everything and anything you require. It has so many useful features that assist you in expanding your social circle and easily interacting with friends and family.

One of such features is the Recently Watched and Saved Facebook Videos. Recently Watched videos help you maintain a watch history, whereas Saved videos help save interesting videos. We have shared the methods of finding them on your account.

We hope it helps!
