### How to Find the Watch Later Videos on Facebook?

Did you know Facebook has a "Watch Later" feature for the desktop version? Yes, you can access this feature for Facebook posts. It appears as a small tab situated at the right side of the uploaded video. Through this feature, you can save a video to watch later. If you do so, the video gets saved in the "Saved" tab.

It's also easy to access them, whenever you want!

### What to Do If I Can't View or Play Videos on Facebook?

One of the most common problems with Facebook is when you want to watch a video but cannot do so. This could occur due to a bad internet connection or technical glitches. The best way to fix these issues is by following the below steps:

* **Check If You Have Strong Internet Connection:**

If you have a slow/dull internet connection there are chances that your video isn't playing due to the same. In that case, you can check for a slow connection by opening some other application. If it shows the same issues, switch to a stronger internet connection. Make sure to connect to strong WiFi or cellular data.

* **Go for a Quick Application Restart:**

Sometimes a quick restart can ensure a swift Facebook video play. So, close the Facebook application on your device and relaunch it. Alternatively, check if there are any recent updates available for the app. If you see any, update the app accordingly.

### How to Delete Watch History on Facebook?

Keep note that your watch history is accessible by you only. However, if you are still skeptical (due to privacy issues), delete the watch history of Facebook. Here's how you can do so:

* At first, log in to your Facebook account with the credentials (email and password).
* Click on Account>Settings & Privacy.
* Navigate to the Activity Log and then go to the Filter section.

* Within the Categories, look for "Videos you've watched."

* **Video Likes:**Your name is visible on the likes of the video if you do the same. Say, if you have liked a video and any friend of yours comes across the post. They may see the term "\[Your Name\] also liked this." Similarly, your name is visible when you comment on the video.
