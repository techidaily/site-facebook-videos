### **Always Pick a Unique and Strong Password**

Always create a unique and strong password for your Facebook account. It can involve alphabets, numeric, special characters and can be lengthy. Mix and match will make it very potent and difficult to use and remember.

Also, use different passwords for different online accounts. If you use the same password, every account can be compromised.

### **Activate two - factor Authentication**

![activate facebook two - factor authentication](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-hack-get-your-account-back-10.jpg)

It's a compelling method of securing your account. However, when you enter your password to log in, you have to enter an additional code sent to your mobile to log in successfully. You must have your mobile with you.

### **Be Cautious of Unknown Devices and Networks**

In case of emergency, you may have to access your account from a public or unknown device. Make sure your log out and never click on **save the password** for this device.

In any case, you must log out from all devices if you feel your account may be unsafe and change the password immediately. In addition, avoid public Wi-Fi with no security for accessing your account.

### **Be Alert on Facebook Messenger**

![facebook messenger hacking video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-hack-get-your-account-back-11.jpg)
