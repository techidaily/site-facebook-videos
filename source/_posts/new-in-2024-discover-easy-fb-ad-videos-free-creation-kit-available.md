### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If you’ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!

### Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If you’ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!
