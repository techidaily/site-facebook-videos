## Part 1: Copyright – Explaining All Important Dynamics to this Legal Right

We have heard people saying, “**Facebook removed my video due to copyright.**” By jurisdiction of the digital community and international laws, copyright is known as a legal right that protects the original authority over the content and information developed. Any work that has been designed, developed, or created by a user has copyright over it once it has been created and deployed.

![what is facebook copyright policy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-copyright-1.jpg)

Talking about what copyright covers in its ambits, a variety of work is catered across this terminology. Any visual or audiovisual work, audio content, and literary work created by users have designated copyrights of the user responsible for its creation. The basic eligibility criteria for such content is to be original to fit the cross-fits of copyright.

This requires the content to have a minimum percentage of creativity that would cater to its plausibility to have copyright over it. However, names, slogans, and titles do not come with the possibility of having copyrights over them.

### How to Know The Content Can Have Copyrights?

Until now, many would question how they can have the idea of the content to own **Facebook video copyright**? To answer this question, it is better to go through a few situations that would explain how a user can assess their content to have copyright. Considering you appear in a video or photo, it necessarily does not provide you the copyrights over it.

On the other hand, anything that you or a client has potentially created provides you with certain copyrights over it. It explains that users can simply understand their position over how original their content is to be called copyright material.

### Rights as Copyright Owner

Being an owner of some content, you can practice certain rights to protect and secure your content from being used on other platforms without your consent. The rights are discussed as follows, providing an understanding of how they can protect their content.

* Stopping from copying and distributing the work.
* Creating new works based on your work.
* Grant permission to users to use the work for a use case.

Copyright infringement, the term recognized over the breach of copyright, occurs when people utilize the copyrighted work without the owner's permission.

### The Duration of a Copyright Protection

Most people would consider **Facebook video copyright** to be a right that users can have for eternity over their content; however, the duration for the copyright protection does not last forever. The work created eventually becomes part of the public domain, losing its position as copyright material. Once the work is available across public domains, nothing can be effectively done under copyright infringement for the content.

### Copyright VS Trademark

Copyright is based on a term primarily based on preventing the duplication of creativity. This term defines the originality of the content and provokes people to create their own ideas. On the other hand, Trademarks are more directed to prevent harm and confusion among customers.

Trademarks are usually consulted over identifying a company that prevents other users from copying their logos and names to confuse the customers. This type is directed towards offering consumers protection over duplication.

## Part 2: I Posted a Video on Facebook, Which was Removed Immediately! What Are My Options?

Are you confused with the question of “**Facebook removed my video due to copyright**?" Videos removed immediately after being posted across Facebook usually contain someone else's copyrighted content. This may occur across the video, audio, or content that has been utilized across the post. However, it is important to look into the reasons and the options that a user may have after removing their video from the platform.

An email and a notification over copyright infringement will be sent to the perpetrator, which includes some confirmations over the point of posting the content. Facebook tries to come up with a middle-way solution for its users, providing them effective results over the issues such as the copyright action. If you are still confident in posting the content, Facebook requires some confirmation or other possibilities to help you publish the content.

On the other hand, if it seems impossible to get to a solution over the ownership rights of the content, users are advised to connect with the owner to resolve the issue directly. Since the notification mentions the content owner who filed for copyright actions, you can easily get in touch with the person to resolve the issue. You can also consider appealing the removal of your content for gaining appropriate reasons over its removal.

The information that is received by the user containing the details of the applicant filing for copyright action is provided as follows:

* Report number and owner's name.
* Email address of the reporting party.
* Details of the report and instructions to be followed, if any.
* Guide to submit an appeal

### What Happens Over Repeating Infringement
