Step 1: Launch your Chrome browser and head to the three dots. Click on "Settings" and then head-to-head to the "Extensions" from "Main Tools."

Step 1: Open your Chrome browser and click on "Settings" from the three vertical dots. Click on "Advanced" from the left panel.

![tap on chrome settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-7.jpg)
