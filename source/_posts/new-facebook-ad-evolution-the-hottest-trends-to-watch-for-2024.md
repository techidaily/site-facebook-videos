### Play with Ad Copy Lengths

The idea that one perfect length will appeal to marketers is a myth. The ideal length works in a range. This should indicate that there is no such thing. You should experiment with the length of your ad copy. While Facebook has guidelines for its ad copies, they are not a hard and fast rule.

What works best for your ad copy varies. It depends entirely on your industry, the type of ad you have in place, and the language of the ad copy. You can increase the length of your ad copy to see how customers respond. You can shorten your ad copy to see the response. It would work best if you had a control post in place. This means you create a post with your normal ad copy length. You can use the metrics to see which one wins out. Sometimes, shorter copies are preferred by the customer. You can come across other data points to help you create a better video ad and ad copy.
