### 6\. People Analytics

 Under the People tab, you get to understand the metrics of like and views of people on your posts. It is further divided into 3 sections.

 Your **Fans section** helps you to analyse the language, age, city, country, and gender of your fans.

 You get a breakdown your page followers according to their language, age, gender, country, and city in the **Followers section**.

 The **People Reached tab** shows the number of people who viewed your post by demographics. You can analyse if the right people, location, and age group are targeted or you need to make corrections.
