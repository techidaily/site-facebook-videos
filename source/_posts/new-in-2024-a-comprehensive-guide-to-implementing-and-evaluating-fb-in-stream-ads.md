There are a few things that you need to look at for estimating the results of **Facebook instream ads**. You should have clear knowledge about Insights and Estimated Earnings. Let us discuss them with you.

### Insights in Creator Studio

Let us first talk a little about Insights. In Creator Studio, the Insight tab shares details with you. From this tab, you get to see the information related to your Pages, earnings, Facebook content, etc. There are two different levels of detail. Either you can view the Page-Level or the Video-Level Insights. Page-level insights include the following factors.

**Audience:** Here, you can take a deeper look at your viewers, your followers. You can also view a demographic breakdown.

**Overview**: Here, you can see an overview of the Page, performance, new followers, net followers, etc. You can also find the summary of Insights for each Page.

### Understand Estimated Earning

**Estimated Earning**s: The amount one earns from ads in videos is known as Estimated Earnings. It depends on the CPM of the ads and also on the number of impressions.
