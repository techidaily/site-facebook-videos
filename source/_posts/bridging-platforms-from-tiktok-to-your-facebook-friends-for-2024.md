TikTok is the fastest growing app in the world that has caught all the gen Z into its whirlwind with the concept of content creation. Most people near us are influencers or content creators who create interesting short videos to entertain people all around the globe.

With an interface similar to Snapchat, TikTok allows you to add filters, sounds, and effects to your 15-second TikTok videos. Even if you don’t hold an account, you can watch thousands of videos on Tik Tok.

But most importantly, as a content creator, you can also share those videos with people on your other social media platforms, such as Facebook. In this article, we will show you how you can share a TikTok video on Facebook.

Part 3: [How Can YouShare Tik Tok Videos to Facebook without Watermark](#step3)

## Part 1: Social Media Integration

The Social Media Industry has grown exponentially with a new app every few years or so. But, TikTok has introduced a new trend that was unheard of before. The content creation angle of it all has empowered everyone to show their skills to the world and entertain all the users on every platform.

What makes social media so powerful is the integration. Users are on so many different apps that it feels like an entirely different virtual universe. To cope with all that, Influencers need to create impactful content that reaches the maximum number of people.

An excellent way to do that is social media integration. A single media file can be shared on multiple platforms to ensure a good reach, which will boost your followers. For example, if you share a TikTok to Facebook, anyone you aren't on TikTok can enjoy it too. With a well-integrated social media presence, your followers will grow over the years.

If you are new to content creation, this article will show you how you can share TikTok to Facebook stories or news feeds.

## Part 2: How Can You Share Tik Tok Videos to Facebook on iPhone or iPad?

If you are an Apple user, you will most likely have a very different method to share your TikTok videos than Android users. To ensure that you can share your videos seamlessly and quickly, we have listed all the steps below. So, Let’s begin:

**1\. Open TikTok:**

Tap on the TikTok app on your iPhone or iPad to open it.

## Part 3: How Can YouShare Tik Tok Videos to Facebook without Watermark

While sometimes you might share videos from TikTok to Facebook, other times you might want to post the same video on Facebook without linking it back to your TikTok account. This is especially useful if you are going to post the same video on your Facebook and Instagram accounts.

However, this can be a bit tricky with the TikTok watermark over the video. But, do not worry, we have got you covered. We will guide you in detail on how to remove a watermark from a video and then share it to your Facebook account. Let’s dive right in:

### To Remove Watermark from Tiktok Videos on iPhone and Android

The software is extremely easy to use, and you can remove any text, logos, or unnecessary objects from your video. You can save the video from TikTok without the logo and username on it. Just follow the simple steps below to remove watermarks from your video.

## Part 1: Social Media Integration

The Social Media Industry has grown exponentially with a new app every few years or so. But, TikTok has introduced a new trend that was unheard of before. The content creation angle of it all has empowered everyone to show their skills to the world and entertain all the users on every platform.

What makes social media so powerful is the integration. Users are on so many different apps that it feels like an entirely different virtual universe. To cope with all that, Influencers need to create impactful content that reaches the maximum number of people.

An excellent way to do that is social media integration. A single media file can be shared on multiple platforms to ensure a good reach, which will boost your followers. For example, if you share a TikTok to Facebook, anyone you aren't on TikTok can enjoy it too. With a well-integrated social media presence, your followers will grow over the years.

If you are new to content creation, this article will show you how you can share TikTok to Facebook stories or news feeds.

## Part 1: Social Media Integration

The Social Media Industry has grown exponentially with a new app every few years or so. But, TikTok has introduced a new trend that was unheard of before. The content creation angle of it all has empowered everyone to show their skills to the world and entertain all the users on every platform.

What makes social media so powerful is the integration. Users are on so many different apps that it feels like an entirely different virtual universe. To cope with all that, Influencers need to create impactful content that reaches the maximum number of people.

An excellent way to do that is social media integration. A single media file can be shared on multiple platforms to ensure a good reach, which will boost your followers. For example, if you share a TikTok to Facebook, anyone you aren't on TikTok can enjoy it too. With a well-integrated social media presence, your followers will grow over the years.

If you are new to content creation, this article will show you how you can share TikTok to Facebook stories or news feeds.

## Part 2: How Can You Share Tik Tok Videos to Facebook on iPhone or iPad?

If you are an Apple user, you will most likely have a very different method to share your TikTok videos than Android users. To ensure that you can share your videos seamlessly and quickly, we have listed all the steps below. So, Let’s begin:

**1\. Open TikTok:**

## Part 3: How Can YouShare Tik Tok Videos to Facebook without Watermark

While sometimes you might share videos from TikTok to Facebook, other times you might want to post the same video on Facebook without linking it back to your TikTok account. This is especially useful if you are going to post the same video on your Facebook and Instagram accounts.

However, this can be a bit tricky with the TikTok watermark over the video. But, do not worry, we have got you covered. We will guide you in detail on how to remove a watermark from a video and then share it to your Facebook account. Let’s dive right in:

### To Remove Watermark from Tiktok Videos on iPhone and Android

Most software these days only allow you to remove watermarks in their premium versions, where you might have to pay some extra bucks to avail that feature. But Apowersoft Recorder allows you to do that for free.

The software is extremely easy to use, and you can remove any text, logos, or unnecessary objects from your video. You can save the video from TikTok without the logo and username on it. Just follow the simple steps below to remove watermarks from your video.

1\. Download the [ApowerREC](https://www.apowersoft.com/record-all-screen)app on your phone and launch it.

2\. Tap on the settings icon in the button on the right corner of your screen.

![Tap on the settings icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-4.jpg)

3\. Make sure you have turned on the Recording Overlay and Screenshot overlay. This will help you to record and take a screenshot of the video simultaneously.

![Turned on the Recording Overlay ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-5.jpg)

4\. By default, TikTok videos are in a vertical format, so you would need to set the recording in the portrait style.

![Set the recording in the portrait style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-6.jpg)

5\. Start the recording now to record the video. If you want to take screenshots of the video, click on the camera icon towards the left edge of your screen.
