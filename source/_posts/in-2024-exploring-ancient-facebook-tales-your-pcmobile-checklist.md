We tend not to save stories to our devices when clicking them directly from the Facebook app. However, you can save a post to your device from the stories archive using simple steps. Let's see how to do it:

**Step 1: Click on your archives**

When you open the Facebook mobile app, you will see your **archive** option on the **top right**. Click on it to **view your old stories**.

**Step 2: Click on a story**

After visiting the story archive, click on the story you wish to save. Click on the **three dots** on the top right.

**Step 3: Save story**

After you click three dots, you will see a save and delete photo option. Click on the **save option** to download it to your device.

## Part 5: How to See Old Stories on a Facebook Business Page?

**Step 2: Click on the story archive**

On the top left, you will see a **story archive** option; click on it.

**Step 3: View story**

When you click on the story **archive**, you will see all your old stories in sequential order; click to view.
