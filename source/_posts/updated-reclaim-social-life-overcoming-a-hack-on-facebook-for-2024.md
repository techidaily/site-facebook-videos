Although hacking of Facebook is very unpredictable, there can be some possibilities that make your account vulnerable. So, keep reading to know all the obvious reasons.

![keep your facebook password safe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-hack-get-your-account-back-2.jpg)
