### Method 2: Ensure a Working Internet Connection

**Facebook videos not playing 2020** occur due to an unstable internet connection. There are multiple devices connected to one router that reduces the speed. Ensure that you are connected to an active internet connection and offer workable speed.

### Method 3: Disable Hardware Acceleration

Browsers use hardware acceleration to bring the perfect user experience for videos preview. However, it doesn't work all the time, so disabling it feels like the right choice.

### Method 5: Update the Browser to the Latest Version

The Facebook videos stop playing due to the outdated browsers. The users are always recommended to log in to Facebook with a browser that is up to date. Download the latest version of your browser in use and steer clear of **Facebook video not playing continuously.**
