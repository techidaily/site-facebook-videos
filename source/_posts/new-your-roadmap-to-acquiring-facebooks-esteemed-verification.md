## Part 1: What is the Blue Verification Badge

The blue verification badge is a seal of your identity. It proves that your pages have a real identity and not fake. Facebook has [three kinds of verification](https://www.facebook.com/help/196050490547892?helpref=popular%5Ftopics) – grey tick pages, blue tick pages, and blue tick profiles.

**The grey tick Facebook pages** represent various organizations and companies that have been verified by Facebook and confirm their real identity.

Confirming your Facebook identity verification is important because [it’s a quick sign that your business, brand, or profile is doing well](https://www.weboptimizers.com.au/blue-tick-verification/) and deserve to earn a verifying sign.
