## Part 1: Why Should You Add A Link to Your Facebook Story?

Like we said, these clickable links that people post on their Facebook stories allow them to have better engagement with their audience. For example, let’s say you have uploaded a recent video on YouTube and you want more people to watch the video; embedding a clickable link on your Facebook story will allow your viewers to watch that YouTube video directly. In addition, your audience will not have to type anything to search for your content.

Adding a link to a Facebook story can be a boon for companies to enhance their sales. This link can boost CTR, click-through rate. Companies should think about adding a link related to their services and products in order to grow their engagement, strengthen their relationship with their prospective audience, and build brand awareness. Facebook stories are not like the regular posts that you see. It appears right on top of people’s feed.
