**Reason 2: It’s been a long time since you deleted your Facebook data on your computer.**

Cached data can cause problems accessing the latest apps, data, and features on your device. So, delete the old data, and then see the difference.

**Reason 3: If you’re a new user of Facebook, you do not get the option to enable the Watch Video tab.**

Many new users find difficulty accessing the problem. In such cases, you can approach online help guides and videos to know how to add the Facebook video icon when you access the platform on your device.

**Reason 4: You’ve not updated the software of your device.**

Much like an outdated application, it’s important to update the software or operating system of your smartphone, PC, or laptop. An outdated app may not support advanced features like a Facebook video icon. So, update the software of your device asap.

**Reason 5: Your phone’s screen or display is too small to see the icon.**

No tv icon on Facebook video could be because the tiny display of your device hides many icons and features. So, you may need to scroll down and up a lot if this is the case.

**Reason 6:** Finally, in order to see the Facebook video icon, you may have to disable another icon in the shortcut bar. Once you’ve done this, only then can you add this icon back on it.

These are the most common reasons when you see Facebook video icon missing. Fortunately, you can fix most of these problems yourself because these are not major ones.

But in some cases, for example, when you don’t know Facebook settings, you’ve to go for alternative solutions.
