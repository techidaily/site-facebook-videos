* **Make it magical or animated:** Animated videos are the best magicians to provoke a magical touch. With just still images, they bring a new world alive before our eyes.
* **Showcase your product personality:** Video being dynamic than photos, **FB cover videos** are the best place to showcase your brand products and services.
