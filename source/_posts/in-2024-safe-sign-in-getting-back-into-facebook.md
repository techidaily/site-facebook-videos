### **Be Cautious of Unknown Devices and Networks**

In case of emergency, you may have to access your account from a public or unknown device. Make sure your log out and never click on **save the password** for this device.

In any case, you must log out from all devices if you feel your account may be unsafe and change the password immediately. In addition, avoid public Wi-Fi with no security for accessing your account.
