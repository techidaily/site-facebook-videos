### Brief Yet Complete

The video must be brief for 7 seconds, but it should convey a complete and comprehensive message. It shouldn't end abruptly without a powerful and thoughtful end. Design the video that sends a profound message in only 7 seconds.

### Entertainment with Motivation

Use instructional videos or cooking tutorials that entertain the audience. You can start from an uplifting and motivational video so that the audience gets a mixture of both fun and inspiring.

### Animated Logos and Portfolio

Animated logos are always a better choice as compared to still logos. Keep your brand logo simple and minimalistic, yet it sends chills down your spine. It means that animated logos say more. The portfolio can be displayed using a wide range of effects. It would play a phenomenal role in sharing your work and its value.
